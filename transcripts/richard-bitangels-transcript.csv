"Unknown","00:00:00:00","00:00:15:50","This year I saw you hosting. The end for you. I am beautiful."
"Unknown","00:00:15:55","00:00:48:13","And one, two, three. Hello. My name is Michael JAG Dave, and I'm a headhunter launching startups with the syndicate. Hailing from the 51st state. You might know it's Canada or Toronto and today we have saved the best for last. We were in gorgeous downtown Phoenix, Arizona at Etherium Phoenix and we just witnessed one of the most powerful pitch competitions I've ever seen."
"Unknown","00:00:48:17","00:01:19:32","Why? As opposed to events like Bitcoin, Vegas, where it's just like a party with Bitcoin on the side. What I saw here is people with the discipline to focus on the fulcrum upon which startups live and die, which is the political, legal, regulatory compliance side. David, you with better angels? What do you attest is the source of your ability to attract founders like this?"
"Unknown","00:01:19:37","00:01:26:34","So did you call me David? I call you David, which is. Yes. Yes. So my name is Richard. Richard. Maybe I should introduce myself. Sorry."
"Unknown","00:01:26:34","00:01:40:52","Yeah. So my name is Richard. I, and the chief of staff for Lunar Digital Assets, where the venture studio known for incubating some unicorns like polygon quick swaps, persistence, calm decks, and quite a few others."
"Unknown","00:01:40:52","00:02:04:39","We've got a few big bets out right now. So that's lit VM, which is a Litecoin layer two. Yes. And then we also have Mattar fly American Fortress, which is a security infrastructure, a fintech security infrastructure play as well. So and we are always out on the look as well for various projects who are, you know, that are great to invest in and to work with as well."
"Unknown","00:02:04:44","00:02:31:07","Now, I'm also, I also host and coordinate the global events here with Beth Angels. And I want to thank you guys for coming here. And so, yeah, what was your question? Sure. How what do you attribute the success of really putting together the right founders in the room? Because it's the founder collection and the traction that really makes an event like this?"
"Unknown","00:02:31:18","00:02:56:18","I think something like that actually stems from our founder, himself. So Michael Turpin, I mean, he's the godfather of crypto. If you guys have ever heard of, a group called CNBC, they actually coined him as the godfather of crypto. We're also the very first, you know, Angel, network and competition or pitch network, that has ever been created for Web3 specifically."
"Unknown","00:02:56:18","00:03:15:51","I mean, every other industry has had it. But this was done 14 years ago with my with Michael Turpin did this. And so not only are we the longest, longest running, but we also have the Godfather involved. And just, just the connections and networks that we're involved with. We're not only here locally and in the States, but we're also international."
"Unknown","00:03:15:51","00:03:38:09","So we have, various chapters or cities, you know, in Korea, Singapore, as well as, you know, London, France, I mean, you name it, you know, we're even discussing potentially having some in Malaysia. We've got our are actually next. We have our next event is actually in Argentina. So yeah, we're gonna be there."
"Unknown","00:03:38:24","00:04:02:38","Wonderful. We want to hackathon for deleting password from Bitcoin wallets. So it's now just passkey and biometrics. Interested. That's the the developer holding the cash. Oh wow. So, I don't know if you guys have ever heard of David Charm. Yes. So, David charm is actually a part of Better Angels as well. He's the godfather cryptography. But, just last week, I, I actually was able to witness, quantum resistance, on the bitcoin wallet and play."
"Unknown","00:04:02:42","00:04:26:37","I met him in Vegas. He's working with Lopp, isn't he? I'm not 100% sure. Yes, that's right, but it's, based off of blue wallet. I think. Gratulations, because that was one of the worries that everyone had on their mind. It was certainly one of my biggest worries. Wow. 60s. The floor is yours. You've seen a lot of the best startups on the planet in this industry."
"Unknown","00:04:26:38","00:04:27:36","Yeah."
"Unknown","00:04:27:36","00:04:51:36","What separates a founder that you believe in from a founder? That is a whole hold, I have to say, tenacity. You know, you see a founder who embodies his product, you see a founder who, you know, really puts in the work and the effort, you know, there's also something called the difference between a missionary and a mercenary."
"Unknown","00:04:51:36","00:05:16:29","You know, there's a lot of people who are founders that come out here, and their entire goal is to exit. Their entire goal is to make money. Obviously, that's a that's a great benefit, but it shouldn't be. In my opinion, your soul goal is to just make money. Money is just a byproduct of you building something that's going to be impactful, that's going to help progress our space in our industry and actually bring solutions and, you know, solutions to the world."
"Unknown","00:05:16:29","00:05:41:55","Right. And that's what I think Web3 is all about. And when we have those founders who are in the missionary category, those are the things that we we look for and those are the things that create a great founder. The last thing I will say is mercenary versus missionaries. Shout out to you, Grand Canyon University. This is a world that was made for your thesis."
"Unknown","00:05:42:00","00:05:50:38","Thank you. Thank you. Amazing. Yeah I apologize. Yeah. See? There's no worries. Yeah, I know,"
