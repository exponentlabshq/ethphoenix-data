"Unknown","00:00:00:00","00:00:32:35","I think that's good. Okay, here we go. Honorable mention from who? Oh, I was hoping. What are you. Oh, yeah. No. No, no. Yeah. To stiff competition, you know. Very, very. Shelton's and friends put together. I have to remember heavy hitters today. Yes. They did. And only one room. Oh, God. Every other event was. Hey, who are you?"
"Unknown","00:00:32:40","00:00:52:24","We needed this to be twice as loud. Dude. Trust me. The thing is, I've been trying to keep the meeting short, but these guys are working on something. Not shit. Until Shelton and Gentry and Chambliss and, like. Whoa. Yeah, they're. I don't know, man, I don't know. Oh, you guys all right, guys? Are you. All right, we're good."
"Unknown","00:00:52:26","00:01:00:19","Everything's solid. I'm gonna do this. All right."
"Unknown","00:01:00:24","00:01:36:36","Hello. My name is Michael Jagdeo, and I'm a headhunter in launching startups with the syndicate. Today, we are in gorgeous downtown Phoenix at Ethereum Phoenix, sponsored by BitAngels. Today, a number of the most powerful startups in the digital currency and digital asset space have just pitched. And some of them have won funding. And today, we're speaking to one of the individuals without which none of this happens."
"Unknown","00:01:36:41","00:02:02:33","A leader of people I know. I'm a long shot. There's no major Justin. Know it's an honor. Nice to be here. You have put together people with the right spirit. And I think that's the hardest thing on the planet to do. How did you do it? Well, we started out of the, the boom of AI in 2021, right when generative AI really started coming around."
"Unknown","00:02:02:33","00:02:27:39","And the creative barrier to entry got significantly lowered, we fell into the independent artist space, and we decided we needed to do something to bring more exposure and opportunities to people because it was very fragmented when we discovered it. So we created the community. We now host a platform. We've curated works all over the world. And yeah, very much looking forward to what the future holds."
"Unknown","00:02:27:44","00:02:57:25","When people think about independent artists, I can. The, you know, the big finance crowd kind of scoff at that. And you talked about the power and why you chose this niche. Well, I mean, there's digital art and everything that you see today, right? Your cell phone, your movies, your TV, every every piece of media that is absorbed through a screen is done by digital artist in one sense of the word or another."
"Unknown","00:02:57:30","00:03:19:27","So as we progress forward and, you know, some of the younger generations start to come up, I look at the traditional art world, and I think, you know, nobody really wants to buy a painting that's going to sit on their wall and, you know, collect dust, essentially. So, you know, we decided to dive into the digital space thinking that mixed media, digital media is definitely the future and where things are headed."
"Unknown","00:03:19:27","00:03:27:53","And I just compliments all of that so perfectly. So I mean, it, you know, it just kind of goes hand in hand."
"Unknown","00:03:27:58","00:03:51:22","What has been the role of, social audio and spaces in growing this community and leading up to this event? I mean, extraordinary, right? Without social media networks, we wouldn't have a platform to be able to to talk about what we do. We wouldn't be curating this event. We wouldn't have curated anything in Albania. So, I mean, the ability to get online and talk to people around the world and tell them what we're trying to do, showcase what we have done."
"Unknown","00:03:51:22","00:04:24:54","I mean, there's there's nothing else like it. I'd like to make the invisible visible and what and what you're actually doing. We never actually had a chance to talk about via the champagne moment for PPN. What would you say that is now that you've seen? Because everyone at this event knows the moment, and knows the trajectory. So now that we're on the tail end of this event, where's people going from here?"
"Unknown","00:04:24:59","00:04:59:39","I think it's an interesting question because there's several routes that we can take, right? We we've just launched the platform. We're involved with several large events at this point, becoming a lot more established in our local communities in Colorado as well here, here in Arizona. So I do believe that there is a future that essentially looks as if, you know, we're building out a platform that can provide sustainable opportunities, sustainable options for artists to get noticed, to get recognized, to build up their portfolios and to to showcase all around the world and for the artists listening at home that maybe they're not a part of."
"Unknown","00:04:59:44","00:05:23:16","Can you talk to me about some of the examples of artists that you've taken from invisible to visible in the world stage? Yeah, absolutely. So we actually we have one. Her name is Nuria List. She's the first muralist artist. She's the first one that comes to mind. I can't remember exactly where, she's located, but she is an AI artist that we curated in through an open call, a little while ago."
"Unknown","00:05:23:16","00:05:44:20","And, she was at the Balkans event we did in Albania event this year, and from that event, I think we've seen some interesting dynamics come because we've had people ask about her work specifically, pertaining to AI, as it kind of morphs and plays into each other outside of that. You know, we've had people frisky Foxtrot is one that comes to mind."
"Unknown","00:05:44:20","00:06:05:16","Yes. We helped him acquire a job, working, doing marketing material, making product launch drops, things like that. And from here. Right. Kind of the idea is like, how else can we keep providing value to our community without draining our pockets? So that comes through. People like stand with crypto, people like, you know, I film three Albania."
"Unknown","00:06:05:21","00:06:19:49","And yeah, just being able to provide those value valued opportunities to people to essentially turn this into a sustainable, career long term."
"Unknown","00:06:19:53","00:06:48:15","As you leave this event, which is I film three Ethereum Phoenix, we have people like Sheldon and PJ and yourself. Can you talk to me about the trajectory of where these people are going? Because it's not so much about like a company or a logo or a website. It's about I see where these people are going. Yeah, I think that's the best thing that you could look at, right?"
"Unknown","00:06:48:15","00:07:11:44","Because a company is nothing without the people behind it. Take away the people, the companies. So I truly think the way that I've seen them curate their inner circle, at least here in Arizona, has been astounding. Astounding, right? I mean, the connections being made here, the connections being made in the past 12 months over even even around the country, outside of Arizona, I mean, it's been unreal, right?"
"Unknown","00:07:11:49","00:07:27:58","Yeah. I think that's the best way to look at it. Right. The people that you're hanging out with is the people that you will eventually turn into or start to become so sure, you know, I look around here, I see the better angels, for example. Fantastic opportunity right there. They're going all around the world right after this event."
"Unknown","00:07:27:58","00:07:45:03","They'll be in Singapore, they'll be in New York, and they're coming back, right, to do a Phoenix later, later next year. And I'm sure other events, as you know, PJ host events here in, Arizona pretty consistently. We're starting to do that in Colorado as well. So looking to expand the networks across the US as much as possible."
"Unknown","00:07:45:07","00:08:11:56","And I think it comes from. Right. The dedication that everybody, myself, PJ Shelton have all been putting in for the last 12 months, because this is not it's not easy. It's not an easy thing to do, not happen by accident. But it's, it's growing. It's growing slowly, but it's growing. And, you know, after this year, after seeing the sponsorships and seeing the support that we got from outside communities, because last year it was 100% independently hosted."
"Unknown","00:08:12:01","00:08:28:34","It just goes to show me that there are people paying attention. There are right in it's and they're not going to stop paying attention anytime soon, by the way. Exactly. You know what I mean? It's not going to turn off that. Yeah. I can't dial any back. No, no, not even not even close. I mean, if anything, they're if they're looking at is ever been a problem."
"Unknown","00:08:28:36","00:08:47:22","If anything, they're looking to ramp it up at every way that they can. Right. These Hollywood production studios, all they want to do is reduce costs and up profit margins. So with the way those films yesterday friggin stunning, oh, they're mind blowing their mind on it. And most of that was expected to see like some janky like three."
"Unknown","00:08:47:25","00:09:05:55","I'm sorry dude. No no no no, I'm not going to lie to you. We we got those we got those submissions. But you know, you have to you have curated the hell out of it. I was shocked and it was tough. It was that was why there was so much content right? We had three full days of movies and no, there was just so much."
"Unknown","00:09:05:55","00:09:32:01","And that's just, that's just a small taste of what is being created right now. I think the independent creator economy has room to grow like it's never grown before, because all those films are startups when we get funded. Absolutely, absolutely. Right. And through p n and PJ and Sheldon, I think you're creating like the artist side. Like they they talk about design development and distribution."
"Unknown","00:09:32:05","00:09:57:45","And you guys have a what a community of like 55,000 networked together. Individuals growing. Yeah. Good luck betting against that community. Yeah. Roughly. If you add everything together I would not short you guys anything you'd like to say? I can say it to the camera. Yeah. Make sure you, make sure you join our discord. Pop in the in discord, we have tons of curated events, curated collections to look at, and we're always doing something fun for creatives."
"Unknown","00:09:57:45","00:10:19:20","So pop in there and get involved. Amazing. This is Michael Jaggu, headhunter launching startups with the syndicate at Ethereum Phoenix put on in conjunction with I film three, sponsored by Bitfury. See you soon. Beautiful, nice. It's hard to keep it to two minutes. Yeah, I get it. Do I get it after doing, you know a little bit. Yeah."
"Unknown","00:10:19:23","00:10:21:14","Yeah, yeah. Because it's a if I just it's."
