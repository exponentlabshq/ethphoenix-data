"Unknown","00:28:12:07","00:28:42:01","Hello. My name is Michael. Jagdeo, and I'm a headhunter launching startups with the syndicate. I am visiting beautiful downtown Phoenix, Arizona, and I hail from the 51st state. You might know it as the Canada's Toronto. And we're here today at Etherium Phoenix being held in conjunction with BitAngels. And today we're meeting with Lilith."
"Unknown","00:28:42:06","00:29:02:57","I caught a bit of her presentation when she was talking about the go to market and the revenue models, and I would love to find out more, because you've been here all week, and I see the way people talk to you and the respect they have for you. And I'd like to learn more about that. Yeah. Yeah, definitely."
"Unknown","00:29:03:01","00:29:30:55","So I'm a builder. Builder at heart. I got my undergrad in entrepreneurship and then at. Now fast forward a few years, I'm currently getting my master's in artificial intelligence. I internships at the Algorand Foundation, and that was kind of the intro into the whole Web3 in blockchain, ecosystem. And I was very intrigued with, the utilities that could come from using these types of decentralized systems."
"Unknown","00:29:31:00","00:30:12:10","So that was what sparked me to start crowd control. Crowd control is a ticketing company, and we are using blockchain technology to enhance the consumer experience and organize their experience. So, I originally started talking to a bunch of artists, organizers, and then obviously I'm an avid concert music goer, myself and friends. And there's pain points on both and the fan side of things there, obviously, hate the most is, the fees associated with like, Ticketmaster and C geek and all these large companies."
"Unknown","00:30:12:15","00:30:46:44","And then they're also kind of sick of scalpers. So people buying up tickets in bulk and then reselling them for an exorbitant price. And then on the organizers side of things, actually, the two biggest thing is, is, artists, especially independent artists in smaller venues, there's just no money. And, music or event hosting. And then too, when they do host events, the settlement times for when they get paid after the event is done actually takes a lot longer than what people would expect."
"Unknown","00:30:46:49","00:31:11:22","So my whole goal was to figure out a solution on how to hopefully keep fees and costs low, and also make sure that artists and organizers have the ability to earn more money. And so that's that's how the ticketing company crowd control was kind of born. I grew up playing music, so, I played trumpet, trombone and steel pan."
"Unknown","00:31:11:36","00:31:47:17","Okay. And what I've noticed in music is you have this, relationship between artist, their fans, and then the venues. Correct. And so far, it seems like they've been set against each other. Yes, a little bit. So there's a big disconnect between the actual artists and the fans. And then there's obviously you have a few different metal entities, such as ticketing, right, where you don't really have a lot of control, or companies such as Ticketmaster, they own actually a lot of venues."
"Unknown","00:31:47:17","00:32:12:56","So you're forced to use doesn't even know that. Yeah, yeah. So, someone fact check me on this. But, when I last did research, like a year or two ago, Ticketmaster or Live Nation, I should say owns like 60 out of, like, the 100 amphitheaters that are here in the US. So if you're a large artist looking to play, one of these amphitheaters, you obviously have to use Ticketmaster."
"Unknown","00:32:13:09","00:32:41:43","And then now you're subject to, to using, or to their contractual terms in terms of ticketing and how much the artist gets paid. They kind of have a monopoly over the system. Which is another reason why I got started due to this. Is because I really think a key aspect in changing people's lives and getting community involved is actually policy, getting aligned with policy and there's been a few things that come out, but it's still pretty vague."
"Unknown","00:32:41:50","00:33:08:42","And, so I think if we align ourselves with policy runs and cool events, get the community involved, I think there's a neat recipe that that could be good. So in a world where you have an incumbent who kind of owns the market. Yeah. What is your go to market strategy? And I ask because I think a lot of the people in this room are facing that same predicament."
"Unknown","00:33:08:42","00:33:37:27","Right? There is an entrenched incumbent that almost owns the market. So I would start, you know, whenever I give pitches or I speak to advisors or investors of this sort, that's the big question is how do you compete with Ticketmaster? And, they have mastery. Yeah. No. Literally. Yeah. No, it's just tough. And if I knew that question fully through, I probably wouldn't be sitting here right now."
"Unknown","00:33:37:27","00:33:57:31","You're probably right. I'd probably be in the Bahamas. That's right. Yeah. So I don't know the answer to everything and how to combat them. What I do say is, numbers don't lie. Ticketmaster, even though they are Live Nation, even though they are the largest, they really are. They only own a relatively small percentage of the entire market share."
"Unknown","00:33:57:36","00:34:24:28","And then I also want to focus on not so much as is worrying about what they're doing, but what can we do as a company to just enhance our our customer base lives? Because I think focusing inward and providing, value, to our product and our service is what's going to make us a key differentiator. And I think the blockchain aspect, is what's going to do that."
"Unknown","00:34:24:33","00:34:31:49","So I like the way you answer that, because it comes down to,"
"Unknown","00:34:31:54","00:34:56:42","Belief, faith, knowing and crossing the river while feeling the stones and actually being, transparent about how this is a known unknown. And I think that's that it worked great. Okay. Sounds good. Well, hey, thank you so much. Yeah. Thanks again. Thank you. My goodness. Okay. Eric said to try to cut down to"
