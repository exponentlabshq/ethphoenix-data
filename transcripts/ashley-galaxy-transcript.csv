"Unknown","00:00:00:37","00:00:29:17","Hello. My name is Michael Jagdeo, and I'm a headhunter in launching a startups with the syndicate. Today, I find myself in the absolutely gorgeous downtown in Phoenix, Arizona. At a few in Phoenix, being produced by BitAngels. And today we are joined by Ashley. And I'm really excited because they told me they saved the best for last. And so here we are."
"Unknown","00:00:29:22","00:00:57:44","Ashley, congratulations. Thank you. You are very highly regarded in that room. And that's not easy to do because what PJ and Better Angels and Shelton and Longshot have done in that room. I went to Bitcoin Vegas. Nowhere near the caliber of people in that small room in that entire convention. Yeah. What do you think it is about this community?"
"Unknown","00:00:57:45","00:01:19:15","Is it Arizona? Is it show and tell me, what is it? So, it's a great question because I've just recently moved here. It's been about, two and a half years. Almost three years, since I've been here. And, I've asked myself that same question. You know, what is it about Arizona? I moved here for a family, but I'm staying here, for business."
"Unknown","00:01:19:20","00:01:56:05","And I think what, brings people together here is the idea that there is a canvas, to paint a very beautiful, portrait on, and especially as it pertains to, to blockchain and the ecosystem that we have here. And so tonight, we were all blessed to have been gathered in this great forum, with so many different ideas and so many different projects, both as builders and as people who are leading initiatives out here to try to bring, the community together."
"Unknown","00:01:56:10","00:02:23:59","And so I feel like what made this special is people who are like minded and who really care about Arizona and the ecosystem and want to see it be successful. I don't think it's real short. We have seven minutes left. Beautiful. Two more people. Two more people. Right. Okay. You mentioned the canvas. What are the key parts of that canvas that make this the one of the best places to build in the Western Hemisphere?"
"Unknown","00:02:24:04","00:02:49:11","That's a good question, too. So, for me, I feel like, there is the support. So you have a lot of great support here from not only your peers, but from government as well. I was just talking about the Arizona Tech Council that's also, very supportive of companies. I also feel that, we have a lot of, the tools that we need to build beautiful things here."
"Unknown","00:02:49:16","00:03:13:08","We're fifth largest city, after all. And we haven't yet hit our stride. So I feel like, you know, this is a great place and makes the canvas. Makes it great because we have a lot of great color here. We're not just, you know, limited to to sort of black and white. I've seen a specific focus on everyone I interviewed is calling it Freedom Technology."
"Unknown","00:03:13:13","00:03:32:32","Can you talk to me about your solution that you that that brings you here today? Sure. So I've been working in real estate, and Scottsdale. Let's I say Phoenix is probably one, I would say one of the capitals in the country for real estate. There's a lot of corporate companies that, find their headquarters here."
"Unknown","00:03:32:36","00:03:55:22","And I've been working very successfully in tokenizing real estate. And so I started working, when I started working, I started working on residential, and then I built a platform for a commercial real estate developer in Las Vegas. And so I want to bring a lot of those, ideas. And so a lot of those lessons here to, a place that I feel like is really thriving in the real estate sector."
"Unknown","00:03:55:27","00:04:14:17","We just happened to be working with an architect with over a decade of experience in the Philippines. Amazing. It's called a resort maker.com. Okay. You think you might have some good ideas for him? Absolutely. I also think that one thing that we should all be conscious of is that every single country has their own set of rules and their own set of, you know, regulations."
"Unknown","00:04:14:21","00:04:37:30","Here in the United States, we happen to be a little more regulated than some of the other countries, say, Switzerland or Panama or some of these other places. But that's changing and that's going to change. I think the new administration has done, you know, really great things. At least in this space. So I would love to, you know, share ideas with them, but I would also need to learn a little bit about, you know, what happens in the Philippines from a regulation standpoint."
"Unknown","00:04:37:35","00:04:42:57","Amazing. We're going to catch up here. I apologize, I don't apologize. Four minutes. Five minutes is."
