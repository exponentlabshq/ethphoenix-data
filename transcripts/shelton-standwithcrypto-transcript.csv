"Unknown","00:01:46:14","00:02:38:21","Hello. My name is Michael Jagdeo, and I am a headhunter in launching startups with the syndicate. I am from the 51st state. You might know it is North America, Canada. And we are joined by Shelton and I am really excited to talk to Shelton because of the people I've been meeting this entire weekend at, I filmed three I left here in Phoenix today we are attending Ethereum Phoenix in beautiful, gorgeous downtown Phoenix, Arizona and in the room over there, very, very accomplished founders are pitching BitAngels for millions of dollars."
"Unknown","00:02:38:26","00:03:34:32","And what interested me the most about Shelton was the maturity, the political, legal, regulatory and compliance maturity. Oftentimes when you go to, digital asset events, let's say the the feeling sometimes is, is, code is above law. Let's say I don't know about you, but I haven't found that to be the case. Yeah, I'm not sure if that's ever going to change, but for now, in order to play in this bitcoin or digital asset or digital currency economy, you must be aware of the political, legal, regulatory compliance environment."
"Unknown","00:03:34:37","00:04:06:54","And today I spoke with. Mr. gentry. Yeah. And I could go on for hours about the maturity with which he's approaching this industry. We talked to Jonathan blew my mind. He is the only person who has mentioned the acronym GAAP generally accepted accounts and principles. I have never I went to Bitcoin Vegas and they didn't say that once."
"Unknown","00:04:06:54","00:04:47:27","Yeah. Yeah. So it's becoming more recognized. How did you do this. Yeah I mean this event honestly I can't take full credit for it. That's for chairman. This is this is many people that have put this together. We we've we've had the privilege of building an amazing community. PJ and I, and PJ, you know, if you guys don't know who PJ as he is the founder of I film three, which is a group that brings creatives and artists together, to showcase their films, you know, to the general public and to other creatives."
"Unknown","00:04:47:32","00:05:07:35","And that's what, you know, that that was the origin of this today. And PJ was gracious enough to, you know, provide a space that we could make the first iteration of Ethereum Phoenix happen. And, you know, the general purpose of of that was so that we can expand on this and 2026 with the partners and relationships that we build over this event."
"Unknown","00:05:07:35","00:05:40:49","This is my this is my first event of this scale that I've hosted. And I had I had lots of help. And a big part of that was that I've been hosting meetups since I'm the chapter president of StandWithCrypto on a weekly basis for over a year. And you know, that that kind of came to my advantage as well, because it allowed me to have many contacts that have interests in the field and who are other, you know, accomplished founders who are interested in supporting something, especially locally here in Arizona, where there's so much potential."
"Unknown","00:05:40:49","00:06:13:23","I mean, you know, the state of Arizona is basically untapped. Yeah. I told, Matthew Earl Jones yesterday that the way he described the activity happening in Arizona was positioning Arizona to be the most important state for province or whatever you want to call it in the Western Hemisphere. Yeah, because of the five C's and now chips being the next one with TSMC and Nvidia."
"Unknown","00:06:13:28","00:06:33:55","And I'm in that room saying, is anyone here with that guy just said, yeah. And you've seen this for a while now. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the state of Arizona is it's it's a blank slate. It's a playground. Yes. And people have a lot of opportunity here. And there's been billions and billions of dollars that have been brought to the state specifically for chip manufacturing."
"Unknown","00:06:34:00","00:07:01:12","And I think that it's not just about the chip manufacturing. I think this is a proof of concept for Arizona being the next Silicon Desert. Is there a chance that Arizona will become a de facto like special economic zone of sorts? Yeah, I definitely believe so. I think we have a lot of room to grow. Arizona is already a large state that I think a lot of people kind of look over."
"Unknown","00:07:01:17","00:07:20:38","You know, we have I think it's about 7 million people in population, which is huge, 5 million just being, you know, here in Maricopa, which is, which is massive compared to many other states. And when you look at wealth distribution as well, I think it was like 150,000. You know, millionaires are here in the state of Arizona. We have 12 billionaires now."
"Unknown","00:07:20:43","00:07:41:08","And we have I think it's just under 100 to millionaires. So the wealth is vast and it's only growing in Arizona, as I said, you know, over and over again, it is this blank slate. It has an opportunity because we don't have a lot of the stuff established, and we're looking for people to establish, you know, all sorts of different businesses when it comes to crypto."
"Unknown","00:07:41:08","00:08:16:46","And I. As we wind down. I'm sold on Arizona. I see the future. And this future is not going away anytime soon. Again, how did you assemble? And you mentioned the meetups where a lot of people can do meetups. Yeah, there is a spirit running through this room that I believe is focused on the right things, and not just the slash and the conspicuous consumption of the things they're talking about aren't the sexiest things."
"Unknown","00:08:16:46","00:08:36:29","But yeah, they are the groundwork. Right? How did you do that? Yeah, I mean, a lot of it was just keeping in contact with with all of these, you know, impressive people. I mean, as I did the meetups, you know, I build connections with these people. And and as time went on, a lot of these individuals are my friends as well."
"Unknown","00:08:36:33","00:08:55:43","So I believe that that that's one of the biggest things that brought me into crypto in the first place was the communities. We have this huge connection with, the communities that look after each other, and this is a prime example of what happens, especially in a place where people wouldn't traditionally think, hey, let's host a film festival."
"Unknown","00:08:55:43","00:09:16:48","Hey, let's host an ethereal Phoenix. Yeah, you know, this, this is this is one of those places where I saw so much potential that, you know, I decided we we have so many great people here. We need to get them together and host these events. And, you know, we have we have many great people that I'm not going to try to have right now."
"Unknown","00:09:16:53","00:09:40:16","But, you know, yeah, I mean, this this was that it was all grassroots. And this was a bunch of us getting together and saying, you know, I'm I want to make this thing happen. I want to make this thing happen in it. And regardless of how many people show up, we're going to do it. And at the end of the day, this is precedent for what is going to happen in the future."
"Unknown","00:09:40:21","00:10:06:49","Well, my part off, and now I like you to just, say what's on your heart and on your mind to the camera. But what I've noticed is that there is a special group of people here that see eye to eye, not just on the financials, but something deeper. I wanted to say, hey, it's, It's okay. Why are people so excited here today?"
"Unknown","00:10:06:49","00:10:36:52","I think we're just sending off. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think it's the growth potential. I think that the state of Arizona and the communities in Arizona have this massive opportunity that honestly, I believe a lot of us haven't recognized fully yet. I think they have I know, I know, and and it's only going to continue. And as it continues, you know, we're going to see the growth and things like this are only going to become, you know, more and more."
"Unknown","00:10:36:57","00:11:00:53","And honestly, my goal here was not that, you know, PJ and Shelton are the forefront of what's happening. It's that we're trying to activate communities so they can come to us so they can make these things larger. Because you know, PJ and I and the group of people that we had behind us, you know, Justin and Eric who's hosting the event that we're at right now, they're all amazing people."
"Unknown","00:11:00:53","00:11:36:19","But this is bigger than us. We're talking about the entire state of Arizona, 7 million people. And, you know, right now, just for stand with crypto alone, we have over 55,000 advocates, 55,000 people that are interested in crypto. It's huge. It's absolutely huge. And it's a market that is not conquered. And we're looking we're looking for people to help us to get into this market so that we can present this to those 55,000 people so that we can get them engaged and so that we can grow that number."
"Unknown","00:11:36:24","00:12:05:50","I'll end off by saying, we say the word community, and sometimes community doesn't like it. We have this traditional understanding of what community is, but I'm seeing syndicates and carrot Susans. So go show shows and an emerging way of how the new corporation works. Yeah, that's what's exciting because these are 55,000 individuals, right? This is a network of 55,000, right?"
"Unknown","00:12:06:01","00:12:25:47","Right. And the network effects of something like that, that's huge with momentum. Yeah. Good luck. Good luck stopping people who are together alone. Right. That's very true. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Perfect. Right. So we can have I have a next person if you want. I'm ready. We want to keep going I'm ready okay. Yeah."
"Unknown","00:12:25:48","00:12:39:32","So let me let me grab them. And any time you want me to end it, I do not think I've interviewed Eric yet. Interview. Very beautiful. Okay. Eric."
