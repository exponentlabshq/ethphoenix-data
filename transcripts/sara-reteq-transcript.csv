"Unknown","00:14:36:21","00:15:04:14","right. Hello, my name is Michael J. And I'm a headhunter launching startups with the syndicate. I hail from the 51st state. You might notice Canada. Okay, I'm from Toronto, and as a headhunter launching startups, I am here at Ethereum Phoenix in conjunction with. I filmed three interviews in some of the most interesting people I believe in the Western Hemisphere."
"Unknown","00:15:04:18","00:15:36:00","I've been to Bitcoin, Vegas, and a few other events. This is the only event where someone talk to me about crypto has mentioned us GAAP generally accepted accounting principles. And so all of a sudden I'm interviewing meeting other people who are actually very interested and typically the most boring yet the fulcrum of the entire industry, which is the political, legal, regulatory compliance environment."
"Unknown","00:15:36:05","00:15:59:59","That's why I'm very interested in meeting you today, because you come highly recommended. And the most beautiful part of it is I don't know why yet. You don't know why. I don't know why yet, but okay. To find out, we are sitting with Sarah Richardson, and the way that people refer almost honor to her means we're going to have an interesting conversation."
"Unknown","00:16:00:04","00:16:29:02","Okay. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Tell the audience a bit about yourself or just me. Well, I'm a local Phoenician. Live here over in Scottsdale, Arizona. So, my background and my domain expertise is actually in real estate. Okay. Which is a highly, highly compliant, correct environment. Been in real estate now for 25 years, and I've worn a lot of different hats in real estate."
"Unknown","00:16:29:07","00:17:06:53","From being a broker, being an agent, been in residential, been in commercial founding, a fairly large female owned real estate brokerage, having sold that warehouse and creating, I to help support and create efficiencies for that real estate brokerage, have now re architected that into a generative AI solution. And now that generative AI solution is now embedded into a larger platform that I just presented on today, which is a blockchain based MLS system."
"Unknown","00:17:06:58","00:17:47:20","Yeah. Okay. I'm thinking about it. Because is it true that the velocity of real estate is hampered by the, fragmented underwriting process? Yes, there's it's hampered by the underwriting process. It's hampered by the, legacy systems. Correct. That real estate agents. And I think actually mortgage is a little ahead of residential real estate systems. It's hampered by the inability for different vendors to speak to one another."
"Unknown","00:17:47:25","00:18:07:08","And the communication overall with all of those vendors, even being able to have a good conversation with the consumer that's actually purchasing real estate, quite frankly, it's one of the biggest ideas I've heard today. Right? Because."
"Unknown","00:18:07:12","00:18:32:02","As, one of the startups we're launching, it's called a resort maker, dot com resort maker, resort maker.com. Okay. Right. And it's exactly what it sounds like. And the features, attributes and benefits of having I call it instead of triple entry accounting I call it end ledger accounting because you can have as many columns on that debit and credit as you want."
"Unknown","00:18:32:07","00:19:12:07","Now what is really tech? Because the technology part is one thing, right? We have AI and we can build with AI. What does it really take to bring? The MLS to distributed ledger technology or vice versa? Not very much. It's just creating the adoption of the users. The average age of a real estate agent is about 56 to 57 years old, and they hear Web3, decentralization, transparency, efficiency and use my license."
"Unknown","00:19:12:12","00:19:52:54","No, they just glaze over, glaze over. They glaze over. Yeah. So it's really coming down to almost not mentioning those things and just providing a better user experience. And I think you could get mass adoption correct. Yeah. The the features attributes and benefits of incorporating distributed ledgers is enough. Right. So. Why hasn't this been done yet. And I mean I can tell from your background why you are confident in your ability to do it."
"Unknown","00:19:52:58","00:20:21:19","Can you talk to me about the the obstacles that you faced in almost like unifying an entire industry, starting here. There's well, I started with AI and it was one tool that was solving one issue. Okay. There are so many other issues to solve that requires an end to end solution that hasn't been done yet. There's all different kinds of tools that are solving."
"Unknown","00:20:21:24","00:20:42:43","There's point solutions, solving various things. But with this solution that a lot of people are coming together, it's not just me. I mean, there's, you know, the leader of the local angels who is, you know, bringing in a lot of different people that can help facilitate an end to end solution. So this has never been done before because it's bringing in so much different talent and so many tools and services into one."
"Unknown","00:20:42:48","00:21:12:00","Furthermore, the fragmentation of the MLS, there's 400, over 480 MLS is in the country, right. In Arizona alone we have 14. You have different, different associations, different MLS. So there's a lot of So I mean, not to get too spicy, but it reminds me of Upton Sinclair. It's hard to get someone to agree to something when their salary depends on them not agreeing with it."
"Unknown","00:21:12:05","00:21:36:35","How do you even begin to start developing consensus with something that has been entrenched for me? I don't know how long these systems are being around. Yeah, 50 years, 100 oh no MLS. What was a book? Right. So that's what I mean. Until the early 90s. And then it was digitized and digitized in the early 90s. And we're still on that same legacy system from the early 90s."
"Unknown","00:21:36:44","00:22:00:24","Right. And I imagine there has been some tweaks and some upgrades, but it's it's clunky. Do you get any pushback where it seems like one of the major ways to avoid pushback is to not mention the nomenclature of Web3, but the features of attributes and benefits that make sense to the stakeholder. Yes. Is that one of the major ways?"
"Unknown","00:22:00:28","00:22:26:25","That's one of the other major ways. And as long as the experience that they're having, because this is a B2B play, right, this isn't we're not going to the consumer. So when we're going to real estate agents and brokers, maybe associations, it has to be the same seamless experience they've had, but better but better. And we have found ways to make it better."
"Unknown","00:22:26:30","00:22:49:21","I believe that from 2009 and 2025, all of crypto has been creating user experiences for innovators and early adopters who only use technology because it's cool and new. But the early majority on this adoption curve we want to get to doesn't use technology just because it's new and fun and exciting. Now they're doing it because they're forced to."
"Unknown","00:22:49:26","00:23:20:10","Yeah, right. And so it sounds to me that what you're building is something not only useful, but like ergonomic for the target market. Can you talk to me about how you make this usable, like the ergonomics of the experience? Because it sounds like that's where we kind of live and die on our successes, how usable it is for these people that have been working in this industry and not have it change for about 25 years."
"Unknown","00:23:20:15","00:23:47:50","Yes, it is less logins. And I know that sounds awesome, but that's a real estate agent and a broker is logging in to, on average, five to even ten technologies. A week. And they don't communicate with one another. So when we can create an ecosystem that mimics all of those 5 to 10 technologies with one login and show them how easy it can be, plus access to the inventory and easier to transact and communicate with their client."
"Unknown","00:23:47:55","00:24:16:51","We believe we can have mass adoption now as we wind down. One of the primary obstacles in onboarding the early majority is they're not even good at remembering one password, let alone 2412 how have you found that experience and onboarding folks? Well, we need to be the truth of source for the data, and we have found a way to be a truth of source above what those MLS is are."
"Unknown","00:24:16:51","00:24:37:48","And I can't speak to that in great detail. But when we can be a truth of source right now to push into those legacy systems, we can show them how one login can push into all the other logins. Amazing. Funny enough, as we end off my cameraman, he's not just a cameraman, he is. His name is Aiden Springer."
"Unknown","00:24:38:02","00:25:08:01","Aiden. Aiden. All right, I like that. Make sure to say hi. He just beat out maybe 250 other software engineers, and he won, the hackathon for deleting passwords from Web3. Wow. All biometrics just past, passkeys. Wow. So now what we can do is, create wallets with biometrics instead of passwords, and it works on every device that that that's amazing."
"Unknown","00:25:08:01","00:25:23:38","Registered on. So I'm a big biometrics fan. Make sure to say hi to him okay. Well thank you. Thank you for having me I. Nice to meet you, Michael. Thank you. Oh, you need your microphone. Thank you, thank you. Yeah. You're welcome."
