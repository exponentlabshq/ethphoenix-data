"Speaker 1","00:00:03:35","00:00:05:36","Back."
"Speaker 2","00:00:05:41","00:00:09:09","So, how's it look? These are just for show then?"
"Speaker 1","00:00:09:13","00:00:14:54","Very much. You guys are I show. Yeah. They sit there in my frame."
"Speaker 2","00:00:14:59","00:00:16:18","Testing. Testing is a sign off."
"Speaker 1","00:00:16:27","00:00:22:42","You know, we have a friend. Oh. Is it is it coming out with the."
"Speaker 2","00:00:22:47","00:00:23:53","I'm actually."
"Speaker 1","00:00:23:58","00:00:27:14","From here. Okay."
"Speaker 1","00:00:27:19","00:00:30:09","So, Mike, by the way. Josh. Josh, so."
"Speaker 2","00:00:30:09","00:00:31:08","Good to meet you. Thanks for having me."
"Speaker 1","00:00:31:10","00:00:48:33","It's an honor. The. The people I've met today are just incredible studs. So for you to have past the just noticeable difference. I'm so excited to learn about what you have. Sure. Because we've met some, like. I mean, you saw them."
"Speaker 2","00:00:48:37","00:00:49:05","I did."
"Speaker 1","00:00:49:09","00:00:50:53","There's some incredible people in that room."
"Speaker 2","00:00:50:55","00:00:51:57","Yeah, there's a lot of test."
"Speaker 1","00:00:52:10","00:00:53:23","Sounding people in there."
"Speaker 2","00:00:53:24","00:00:55:20","Phoenix has a lot of talent."
"Speaker 1","00:00:55:25","00:01:01:01","I come from Toronto. I'm like, you know what? Like, ever. I know we have Waterloo and blah, blah, blah, but it's very."
"Speaker 2","00:01:01:10","00:01:20:38","So I went to, one of the, one of my co board members for sport del Elena. So look over. Also did, crypto chicks since they invited us up to Toronto. And I walked around Toronto, going. So what does it feel like to live in the birthplace of Ethereum? And they're like, what's that? It's like mean."
"Speaker 2","00:01:20:43","00:01:25:56","Come on. You you live in Toronto? Like what? I know Waterloo's like what? I was a suburb, or."
"Speaker 1","00:01:26:01","00:01:40:09","It's, It might as well be a special economic zone, right? Right. The joke is that, San Francisco is a wrapper on Waterloo. More specifically because of all of the interns that get funneled through."
"Speaker 2","00:01:40:13","00:01:41:31","So, like a pipeline."
"Speaker 1","00:01:41:36","00:01:50:01","Incredible pipeline. I went to U of T, so I went to, like, the lesser of two schools. So shout out to Waterloo, you one. I can say."
"Speaker 2","00:01:50:06","00:01:51:42","What is the U of T? University of."
"Speaker 1","00:01:51:42","00:02:04:39","Toronto. University of Toronto. Okay. The lesser of the two. Yeah, I think it's like third it goes Waterloo. And then Queen's had an s even though they don't officially publish it. It's kind of an informal rankings like."
"Speaker 2","00:02:04:39","00:02:11:58","I understand that feeling because I went to American University. Okay. Which is not one of the first three that people think of when they think of DC schools."
"Speaker 1","00:02:11:58","00:02:16:21","Right? Right, right. Well, it looks like the DC experience is paying off."
"Speaker 2","00:02:16:26","00:02:19:51","I yes I do. Yeah I wouldn't trade that for anything."
"Speaker 1","00:02:19:53","00:02:38:00","No. So it's interesting because I'm again I'm discovering everything here for the first time. I've noticed a certain maturity with regards to the political, legal, regulatory compliance approach of the people in this room. Have you found that."
"Speaker 2","00:02:38:04","00:02:40:41","Significantly higher than a lot of other crypto rooms that I'm enjoying."
"Speaker 1","00:02:40:41","00:02:48:20","Significantly? What is that? I went to Bitcoin Vegas and nobody mentioned us GAAP. And the first conversation I have is."
"Speaker 2","00:02:48:25","00:02:55:09","I think that's a credit to Sheldon. Yeah. So he and it's the pin you're wearing the same with crypto."
"Speaker 1","00:02:55:10","00:02:55:59","That's why I have it here."
"Speaker 2","00:02:56:00","00:03:16:47","And so the people in and around his ecosystem, and this is one of the ways we became friends was, was through this, advocating for reasonable, sensible policies. There's a there's a sense in the broader crypto ecosystem and a lot of and they're what I describe as sneakerheads. So this is like people who are always chasing the fad, trying to make a quick buck."
"Speaker 2","00:03:16:52","00:03:38:42","The gamblers are going to go from one thing to the next. Correct. And this is just the, the ecosystem where the grass is the greenest because the it is the Wild West. And under Gary Gensler SEC, they were penalizing companies that were trying to do things the right way. So like Coinbase tried to dot every eye and cross every tee and got a Wells notice."
"Speaker 2","00:03:38:46","00:03:55:05","Uniswap same thing. And so these companies found and not even companies they're like we're not going to form a company. We're just going to YOLO meme coins. And because we call it a meme coin and don't promise an investment, it's not subject to the SEC. And so gamblers moved to that and dumped a ton of money into it."
"Speaker 2","00:03:55:19","00:03:58:14","But this is a very different crowd. This isn't the chasing meme."
"Speaker 1","00:03:58:14","00:03:59:22","Coin is not that."
"Speaker 2","00:03:59:27","00:04:04:28","Now there's a lot of serious people in crypto, and if you find the right room, you're in the right place."
"Speaker 1","00:04:04:33","00:04:18:42","We are in the right room and I believe we're in the right state. Actually, with everything I heard yesterday about the TSMC and the chips. This might be one of the most important regions in the Western Hemisphere, depending on how things shake out."
"Speaker 2","00:04:18:49","00:04:20:25","Yeah, absolutely."
"Speaker 1","00:04:20:30","00:04:37:10","And you two are right from the judge's perspective at the top of the list. I appreciate the audience how you became so competitive and such a stacked room."
"Speaker 2","00:04:37:15","00:04:54:51","I think what put me over the top was probably the live demo. This is, and I'm sure my CTO was like, oh, he's going to try to do a live demo. This is like just in the, in the tech industry, if you ever try to do a live demo, it doesn't succeed. But I think that's a credit to the quality of my tech team that I was able to do a live demo, and,"
"Speaker 2","00:04:54:56","00:05:06:42","And it worked. We were able to easily log into the platform, open a CDP, and then show that this is the stablecoin that we minted against, ETH."
"Speaker 1","00:05:06:47","00:05:09:28","CDP it is that collateralized debt something."
"Speaker 2","00:05:09:34","00:05:12:07","A collateralized debt position? Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00:05:12:12","00:05:15:57","Again, you don't usually hear this language, so."
"Speaker 2","00:05:16:02","00:05:35:02","And this gets into the fundamental and this is I think we're or we're bitcoiners and Ethereum's agree. Is, is that the reason that we exist, the reason we're building, the good side of crypto is that the traditional money system, dollars aren't backed by anything. You know, where you're not agreeing."
"Speaker 1","00:05:35:02","00:05:36:04","Or, you know, you're right."
"Speaker 2","00:05:36:04","00:05:39:48","They're not. They're not backed by anything. It's backed by full faith and credit and threat of nuclear."
"Speaker 1","00:05:40:00","00:05:42:38","Maybe. Maybe here or there. Yeah. Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00:05:42:43","00:06:03:50","Used to be backed by gold. No longer backed by anything. So this is when you start getting into stablecoins or like, okay, well, what is the stablecoin backed by and with. You've got centralized stablecoins like, circle's Usdc and Tether's Usdc, dollar and dollar out. They're a little bit opaque with their bookkeeping, but they're basically making all this money on US dollar deposits, buying treasuries."
"Speaker 2","00:06:03:54","00:06:18:54","So you can you got decentralized stablecoins okay. So let's recreate the pre 1930s American system of fiat where the dollar the stablecoin is backed by more than 100% value where the something of value."
"Speaker 1","00:06:18:59","00:06:21:04","Almost like the creature from Hyde Island."
"Speaker 2","00:06:21:08","00:06:44:17","Sure. Exactly. But instead of gold we very specific because there are other great projects that are trying to do other things with stablecoins. We decided to lean into our blockchain for good. Okay. Climate tech. Okay. Like we all have to live on this earth. I've got kids. I would like their children to grow up in a water and food secure environment."
"Speaker 2","00:06:44:22","00:07:11:32","And not leaning into the messaging of, you know, we're bleeding heart liberals trying to save the planet. It's we built a fundamentally stable DeFi platform that happens to use climate debt and climate finance assets as collateral. So we're not asking for donations. We're not asking people to be charitable. We're saying, use this platform. You're going to make money, the assets that are the collateral."
"Speaker 2","00:07:11:32","00:07:13:21","So we're talking about carbon credits."
"Speaker 1","00:07:13:21","00:07:16:00","Yes. Green bonds was looking for the name correct."
"Speaker 2","00:07:16:07","00:07:29:44","Rex, which is renewable energy certificates. Which like, like municipal bonds. And then PPAs, which is purchase power agreements. So like, if one company is borrowing from another for solar."
"Speaker 1","00:07:29:49","00:07:43:44","So you're talking about stablecoins being used for CDPs that are used to run governments at a time when governments are bankrupt in the US and shut down."
"Speaker 1","00:07:43:49","00:07:45:08","Right."
"Speaker 2","00:07:45:13","00:07:48:33","Well, stablecoins function without government. Is that what you mean?"
"Speaker 1","00:07:48:38","00:07:59:24","Well, I'm just looking at if it's true that, the beneficiaries of this solution are municipalities."
"Speaker 2","00:07:59:29","00:07:59:49","They could."
"Speaker 1","00:07:59:49","00:08:03:37","Be. You could be one of the most important things at this moment in time."
"Speaker 2","00:08:03:37","00:08:26:59","Yeah. So right now we're focusing on climate tech, but there are a lot of, like in the Chesapeake watershed area where municipal bonds go toward and on the east Coast, like building walls, border wall seawalls, so these municipalities could issue a bond that is environmentally focused, or equity focused. We can use that bond as collateral."
"Speaker 2","00:08:27:04","00:08:43:38","And then instead of the city of Baltimore, we're working on a pilot there. Instead of trying to just ask people, hey, give a give the city money, which people don't generally like to do, if we can put it on chain and get people from around the world to speculate on it, game over. Yeah. And now people."
"Speaker 1","00:08:43:38","00:08:45:32","Are like betting in the future. Arizona."
"Speaker 2","00:08:45:37","00:09:03:28","Yeah, yeah. You could do the same thing with Phoenix Arizona bonds. I mean, we're we are in a state where we will be out of water very soon. Correct? I don't I don't know the exact estimate, but, California or Colorado could just shut off our water at any point. Right. What are we going to do? So. Right."
"Speaker 2","00:09:03:32","00:09:04:44","Continue to raise money to import."
"Speaker 1","00:09:04:44","00:09:09:42","Water, make it to the speculative market, and bring in an very TSMC."
"Speaker 2","00:09:09:47","00:09:24:05","Sure. And, and so when you allow people to speculate, more money flows into the ecosystem. And we would prefer people speculate on things that help rather than just have mathematics."
"Speaker 1","00:09:24:10","00:09:42:14","Speculation is a human behavior that has been here before. We had language. Yeah. And if we can, transform that risk and propensity into something that's useful, like bringing water to Arizona, I can see why you want. Congratulations."
"Speaker 2","00:09:42:14","00:09:45:25","I didn't even talk about any of that, but thank you. You. You saw the judges must."
"Speaker 1","00:09:45:30","00:09:47:56","Say I saw it. Thank you so much."
"Speaker 2","00:09:48:00","00:09:49:23","Yeah, of course."
"Speaker 1","00:09:49:28","00:10:00:19","I appreciate it. Amazing. Guys, anything we haven't talked about before, we press stop? We covered everything."
"Speaker 2","00:10:00:24","00:10:03:08","Sure. Well, we're raising money right now."
"Speaker 1","00:10:03:11","00:10:05:56","Oh, yeah? Yeah. How much did you get from these guys?"
"Speaker 2","00:10:06:00","00:10:07:32","Well, I'm in here instead of out there."
"Speaker 1","00:10:07:47","00:10:08:37",""
"Speaker 2","00:10:08:42","00:10:13:07","So, trying to lock in some commitments. All right, go for it. It feels good."
"Speaker 1","00:10:13:12","00:10:17:21","Then. Any way I can help? What's the best way to get in touch?"
"Speaker 2","00:10:17:26","00:10:31:48","I don't have a name tag. Yeah, so we're at Asos finance. I'm on on Twitter at zero x Joshua SL. And then you can email me at Joshua at Aztec."
"Speaker 1","00:10:31:52","00:10:38:16","Follow for me as well. Awesome. What's the, password as the email."
"Speaker 2","00:10:38:21","00:10:39:02","The password."
"Speaker 1","00:10:39:04","00:10:40:07","Thank you. Yeah, yeah."
"Speaker 2","00:10:40:18","00:10:41:53","Joshua at Azteca."
"Speaker 1","00:10:41:53","00:10:42:21","Joshua."
