"Speaker 1","00:00:00:00","00:00:01:46","Mike."
"Speaker 2","00:00:01:51","00:00:02:28","Isabella. Nice."
"Speaker 1","00:00:02:36","00:00:05:31","Isabella, are you from here?"
"Speaker 2","00:00:05:35","00:00:12:48","So originally, I'm from Washington state. Okay. I go to Grand Canyon University, so I'm in Arizona for school right now."
"Speaker 1","00:00:12:53","00:00:14:14","What made you go there?"
"Speaker 2","00:00:14:19","00:00:15:37","The business program."
"Speaker 1","00:00:15:42","00:00:16:21","The business program."
"Speaker 2","00:00:16:22","00:00:26:51","Business program is excellent. Really? They have a fantastic set of programs and just a really well-rounded business ecosystem there."
"Speaker 1","00:00:26:58","00:00:27:43","What is it called?"
"Speaker 2","00:00:27:48","00:00:28:58","Grand Canyon University."
"Speaker 1","00:00:29:00","00:00:34:42","Grand. Canyon University. And so you said you're from Washington state."
"Speaker 2","00:00:34:44","00:00:37:23","I'm from Washington state."
"Speaker 1","00:00:37:27","00:00:46:56","With all of the choices for a business degree. Yes. There must be a reason that you chose Grand Canyon. Yeah. Well, what made it stand out?"
"Speaker 2","00:00:47:01","00:01:10:22","Well, there was a series of things I was looking for a Christian school one. So that narrows down your options quite a bit. I wanted to be out of state because I just wanted to travel experiences. And the most important one for me was, Tim Kelly actually. And he's the head of the entrepreneurial program. At Grand Canyon University."
"Speaker 2","00:01:10:22","00:01:31:33","And so he basically built out this program. And when I was touring colleges, we made it a note to talk to the people who were the head of whatever program we were looking at. And it basically everything that he told us about that they had to offer that they were building was something that I'd never heard of a college even doing."
"Speaker 1","00:01:31:38","00:01:51:05","They so they didn't even have the word startup when I went to business school. So I went to the University of Toronto, blah blah blah, did a business degree call up the whole nine yards. And so that's why I'm so interested in this topic, because entrepreneurship and startup wasn't even being addressed the university level when I was going."
"Speaker 1","00:01:51:05","00:01:54:57","So. Tim Kelly, can you tell me more about his background and what impressed you?"
"Speaker 2","00:01:55:02","00:02:19:56","Yeah. So, he's the head of the entrepreneurial program. I used to be an entrepreneurship student myself. Not currently, but I still work pretty heavily with the program. And he basically, when I sat down with him, he told us about those two things that they had at the time that I heard about first was Idea Club. Idea club is a, it's a club for people who are starting their own businesses."
"Speaker 2","00:02:20:01","00:02:24:25","Helps them start. Gets them involved. Gets their products in the market. One of the guys who is."
"Speaker 1","00:02:24:27","00:02:25:19","Really."
"Speaker 2","00:02:25:24","00:02:31:19","One of the guys who went through that, I think he's made probably over $300,000 at this point since the best."
"Speaker 1","00:02:31:28","00:02:44:40","So Idea Club, although we're not supposed to talk about it, is, like an ideation to manifestation to commercialization practice within. It's a club."
"Speaker 2","00:02:44:41","00:03:04:06","He's the chief advisor for that. And then on the flip side, and this is what I ended up getting involved in is Canyon Angels. And so GCU is the only college right now in the country, potentially the world that has its own student run and operated angel investment group. So what that."
"Speaker 1","00:03:04:12","00:03:05:18","Year, kid?"
"Speaker 2","00:03:05:29","00:03:07:48","That's correct. Yes. So with that."
"Speaker 1","00:03:08:00","00:03:11:02","I thought you meant like Charlie's Angels. But you talk about Angel."
"Speaker 2","00:03:11:02","00:03:27:11","An angel investing. Yeah. So what that means is that they're student teams and a student organization. It was founded by Tim Kelly ten years ago, and he basically just lets the students do their thing. So we have in."
"Speaker 1","00:03:27:11","00:03:29:14","Terms of capital allocation."
"Speaker 2","00:03:29:17","00:03:29:42","No."
"Speaker 1","00:03:29:55","00:03:32:18","Okay. Angel group."
"Speaker 2","00:03:32:22","00:03:43:28","What is an angel investing group? It's a group of angels coming together, looking at companies, deciding if they want to put money into those companies. So what the students do is they come in to be a middleman between the companies and the investors."
"Speaker 1","00:03:43:32","00:03:44:34","I see, I like to."
"Speaker 2","00:03:44:34","00:03:47:12","Find the startup companies. We have a so."
"Speaker 1","00:03:47:13","00:03:48:50","You're the scouts."
"Speaker 2","00:03:48:55","00:03:53:54","Kind of kind of. Well we find we have someone on deal flow. Okay. He finds the companies."
"Speaker 1","00:03:54:01","00:03:54:37","Okay."
"Speaker 2","00:03:54:41","00:04:15:04","The companies go through our funnel, right? We then pick three companies a month, and then we send them out to student teams. Student team is one team lead. Plus somewhere between, 6 to 10 students. And those students spend a month, they talk to the CEO. They talk to people in the industry. They do all of the research that you do the due diligence."
"Speaker 2","00:04:15:08","00:04:16:52","They put together a five minute presentation."
"Speaker 1","00:04:16:52","00:04:19:51","So they underwrite the deal they do in a manner."
"Speaker 2","00:04:19:59","00:04:26:13","They just do the research. So they find all of the information that the investors that we have coming through don't have time for."
"Speaker 1","00:04:26:24","00:04:26:57","Right."
"Speaker 2","00:04:26:58","00:04:51:34","And then we have a big pitch event. And so at that pitch event we have the companies come in. So they give ten minute presentation of their companies. It's a pitch event and the investors can ask questions. And then the students come up. They give their five minutes of it's just straight due diligence, no opinions, just information. And then the investors ask students questions on what they found out."
"Speaker 2","00:04:51:34","00:04:57:33","They were digging through the financials, through all the company's documents, right through all of all the things happening and."
"Speaker 1","00:04:57:38","00:05:00:12","Maybe some key ratios that are employed in the business."
"Speaker 2","00:05:00:12","00:05:10:17","Whatever is happening there. And so then after that event, the investors themselves decide if they want to put money into it. Sometimes we run a if there's enough people."
"Speaker 1","00:05:10:28","00:05:11:02","Sure."
"Speaker 2","00:05:11:07","00:05:23:45","But we have a pretty active investor base. We've got incredible paying members, about like 25 right now and, probably around 40 that show up on a consistent basis."
"Speaker 1","00:05:23:50","00:05:40:57","So having this much experience in the startup world, an ecosystem here, what have you observed? What do you like, what don't you like, and how is it? How is that shaping how you finish your degree and get into industry?"
"Speaker 2","00:05:41:02","00:05:49:58","Well, it's completely changed everything. I mean, I came into GCU knowing that it existed, but not what it meant."
"Speaker 1","00:05:50:07","00:05:50:49","Correct."
"Speaker 2","00:05:50:54","00:06:08:24","And what it does is it's giving me a lot of confidence in my ability to learn things. And Phoenix is a place where there's so many things that are starting. So being a part of the ecosystem of starting things or entrepreneurship in a starting economy."
"Speaker 1","00:06:08:24","00:06:09:03","Right."
"Speaker 2","00:06:09:04","00:06:09:43","Is."
"Speaker 1","00:06:09:43","00:06:11:24","It is kind of a startup economy."
"Speaker 2","00:06:11:24","00:06:12:40","Isn't it? It is know the."
"Speaker 1","00:06:12:40","00:06:15:27","Whole like Nvidia TSMC."
"Speaker 2","00:06:15:27","00:06:17:36","Thing is so many things happening."
"Speaker 1","00:06:17:38","00:06:28:26","God what has happened with the state. This could become the I was telling something that this could be the most important state in the Western Hemisphere if they keep with these relationships."
"Speaker 2","00:06:28:29","00:06:48:30","Yeah. And it's it's crazy. You see all these things. I mean, we have delegates from other countries coming in and working with companies and like, it's just all sorts of things, from Venture Cafe to we've got the different venture funds that are focused on specifically early stage startups. You've got, ag, VC and Monsoon Ventures. They're both early."
"Speaker 1","00:06:48:33","00:06:52:54","A16z is here as well. Arizona. Arizona. Okay."
"Speaker 2","00:06:52:59","00:06:53:50","Easy."
"Speaker 1","00:06:53:55","00:06:55:33","Easy VC. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha."
"Speaker 2","00:06:55:35","00:07:03:04","Arizona. Venture capital and also ventures. They're both venture groups. We work with them fairly closely just because they have so much insights."
"Speaker 1","00:07:03:09","00:07:05:33","I think one of the biggest kept secrets in North America,"
"Speaker 2","00:07:05:38","00:07:15:48","Yeah, in a lot of ways. And so just being there and we put the students just in front of a firehose, we basically stick them on a team. Yeah. No information on what's happening."
"Speaker 1","00:07:16:00","00:07:16:23","Let's take a."
"Speaker 2","00:07:16:24","00:07:31:14","Class on economics. They don't know anything. And and then we just teach them how to ask questions and teach them how to poke into things, to learn more, to go from knowing nothing to being able to explain a company to investors better than the CEO cow."
"Speaker 1","00:07:31:19","00:07:37:17","Which is up. Sometimes the CEOs are so close to the business they don't. You know what I mean?"
"Speaker 2","00:07:37:18","00:07:48:53","Yeah, we do a lot of, medtech investing because of our professors. He is his name is Mike Lang, and he is an emphasis in biotech because he's a teacher, both entrepreneurship and engineering."
"Speaker 1","00:07:48:53","00:07:49:25","Okay."
"Speaker 2","00:07:49:26","00:07:53:16","Career was spent in biotech. It's makes it's there. And so."
"Speaker 1","00:07:53:21","00:07:55:10","Like in the park side."
"Speaker 2","00:07:55:15","00:07:55:36","Like."
"Speaker 1","00:07:55:36","00:07:57:23","The robotics side or something else."
"Speaker 2","00:07:57:28","00:08:14:36","I don't know what they are exactly. We talked about them okay. Had a bunch of companies. I think 1 or 2 of them might have exited. Tim Kelley itself had exits in or an exit in a Spanish emergent preschool, a couple years back. So there's all sorts of, like, these are people with real business. You're here for the fun of it."
"Speaker 2","00:08:14:36","00:08:17:18","They're not here because they need to be. Yeah, none of them need the money."
"Speaker 1","00:08:17:26","00:08:22:46","They're here to give back to their 2017 year old self, perhaps. Yes. Right. That kind."
"Speaker 2","00:08:22:46","00:08:40:32","Of thing. Exactly. And so we have expertise and investors who are interested in the students. And so we rely on some of them to kind of help teach us things. And I've had companies come through and like there was a company called Crispr QC that came through Crispr. Crispr QC."
"Speaker 1","00:08:40:32","00:08:41:12","Wo."
"Speaker 2","00:08:41:17","00:09:07:24","Was a basically SAS plus Crispr in a way. And so the company, when they came through like they were so detailed because it was such a fascinating company like, yes, you are completely valid in being very detailed and having all this information. Investors don't know anything about that. Like, I didn't know anything about that. But you put a student up there, you teach them how to get down to the bare bones of what's happening."
"Speaker 2","00:09:07:24","00:09:10:34","And in 10s they'll tell you what the company's doing faster than the CEO."
"Speaker 1","00:09:10:43","00:09:15:26","It's almost like managing a complexity budget for the for the investor."
"Speaker 2","00:09:15:26","00:09:30:25","It's it's really interesting. And so I've been a part of that for two and a half years now. I started as a student analyst presenter. I became a team lead. I did the investor relations side first semester and and now I'm the current director."
"Speaker 1","00:09:30:40","00:10:04:42","Well, now as we wind down, because I know this is a startup ecosystem, this might be the most because of the whole chips thing and blah, blah, blah. Yeah, that might be legit. The most important state in the Western hemisphere. See, can you talk to me about that which we've ignored, not ignored, but, left out, which is the role that your faith is having in your career?"
"Speaker 2","00:10:04:46","00:10:25:15","Well, everything I do is because God placed me here and that's at the base of it. I chose GQ, I was going between six colleges and I came down to two of them. I was in a room for four hours, like writing down different like value charts that."
"Speaker 1","00:10:25:20","00:10:26:24","You know, the value."
"Speaker 2","00:10:26:26","00:10:47:05","One does normal things, right. And I was sitting there, I just could not make a decision. And I was like, well, I haven't actually prayed about this, so I should probably do that. So I sat down and I closed my eyes. I was like, all right, Lord. GQ. I was like, wait, I didn't ask yet. And really, it was just like a complete surety that this is where he wanted me to be."
"Speaker 2","00:10:47:10","00:11:01:32","And every step of the way, every person that I've met, every opportunity to grow as an individual, to grow in my faith, to grow as a business professional, has all been because God put me where I'm supposed to be."
"Speaker 1","00:11:01:37","00:11:04:09","That must be one of the most powerful feelings on the planet."
"Speaker 2","00:11:04:09","00:11:18:33","It is, and it's incredible. And we're consistently new. Things are coming, and I love to just be in a place where I can watch all of these people come together for God's purpose. Like Jesse right now. Is putting together an ETF here."
"Speaker 1","00:11:18:35","00:11:20:48","Kidding. No."
"Speaker 2","00:11:20:53","00:11:24:20","And for like, faith based companies."
"Speaker 1","00:11:24:20","00:11:27:22","Yes, yes. And what has that have been done? I don't."
"Speaker 2","00:11:27:22","00:11:29:04","Think so. I'm like."
"Speaker 1","00:11:29:04","00:11:31:01","When you guys, you would be the people who do it."
"Speaker 2","00:11:31:03","00:11:40:53","We are the people that would do it. And we are like, GQ is building a faith based servant, leadership based."
"Speaker 1","00:11:40:58","00:11:44:41","John C Maxwell driven approach approach to."
"Speaker 2","00:11:44:43","00:12:12:47","Teaching students how to enter into the workforce, teaching them entrepreneurship. You go into our business building the Cob. You see big letters on the wall about servant leadership and entrepreneurship. Those two things, right? And that's what they build the values of the business students on. And it's just being in that environment makes me want to reach higher, to do things for God's world, for the vision that he has for our."
"Speaker 1","00:12:12:47","00:12:14:24","It's a different kind of ambition."
"Speaker 2","00:12:14:29","00:12:15:45","Yeah it is."
"Speaker 1","00:12:15:45","00:12:19:04","And servant leadership driven ambition."
"Speaker 2","00:12:19:13","00:12:20:13","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00:12:20:18","00:12:21:35","As powerful, isn't it?"
"Speaker 2","00:12:21:35","00:12:24:10","It's unlike anything else that I ever."
"Speaker 1","00:12:24:23","00:12:59:33","I haven't I've come across a few things lately, but this is not one of them. So, lastly, would you mind, just taking a look, at camera number one and I know there's something that I haven't asked you, but this is probably the first time the audience has heard about a faith based university that is taking a leading role in building Arizona's economy from the startup ground up."
"Speaker 1","00:12:59:38","00:13:15:42","And this is happening during a time when Intel and TSMC are visiting the state to talk about making chips here, which we don't do in the Western Hemisphere right now, as far as I know. So please go ahead."
"Speaker 2","00:13:15:47","00:13:44:00","Yeah. I mean, this college opportunity that I have been giving is that we are being put in a position to become leaders in an economy for a better purpose, and that economy is coming to us. We don't even have to go out and reach after we've been given these skills and these opportunities. All of these opportunities are coming together in one place."
"Speaker 2","00:13:44:05","00:14:09:29","And it is incredible because we are one of the fastest growing schools in the country. And you just think about that. And our business school is one of our biggest programs in there. And so you have all of these students coming in together to work on. We have an investment club that manages an investment portfolio of millions of real dollars."
"Speaker 2","00:14:09:34","00:14:35:26","Like that is insane. And all of these students are being imbued with the same principles to not just grow money, but to better our economy, to make this a place that is worth living in, to use that money for the purpose of things that are good in a lovely and they're a good report for the purpose of God's will and to make our families better."
"Speaker 2","00:14:35:26","00:14:46:22","And, and it's just it's a one of a kind experience. And that's all happening in Phoenix, Arizona. And it's incredible."
"Speaker 1","00:14:46:26","00:15:17:36","I don't think people recognize how powerful John C Maxwell and friends are in the secular business community. With servant leadership. Yeah. Of all of the leadership talks I've heard the concept of servant leadership, about leadership, about being about serving, not about, dictatorial, autarky, because I think that's what people think of, the CEO king in the castle, you know, the perspective of serving people."
"Speaker 1","00:15:17:40","00:15:20:10","It sounds like this is unstoppable."
"Speaker 2","00:15:20:24","00:15:41:20","Yeah. And I've seen it in my own life. And like I said, right now I'm the current director of Canyon Angels. Like insane opportunity. Talk about God putting things in your life that you do not feel prepared for. That is one. I mean, he puts us in positions not because we believe we're qualified because we need to rely on him to be qualified."
"Speaker 2","00:15:41:25","00:16:00:15","That way we can't just look at ourselves and say, I did this because I didn't do this. Nothing that I did put me here. Well, I mean, I followed what he asked me to do, and it's not because I'm amazing or great that I got this opportunity, but because he has given me this opportunity and I have to rely on him for everything."
"Speaker 2","00:16:00:15","00:16:27:26","And in that, it's become the focus that has been taught to me, the focus that I believe in, that everything that I do is for the growing of the community that I've been given to handle, and trying to pour back into the students, trying to prepare the ones coming after me. Because college, like if you talk about company turnover rate, a college student run group has the most insane turnover rate you can possibly."
"Speaker 1","00:16:27:26","00:16:31:04","Imagine, and people are only there to pad their resumes, I think get an internship most like."
"Speaker 2","00:16:31:06","00:16:48:32","They graduate within 2 to 4 years at GCU. Three and a half is probably average. So yeah, they all graduate early, which means that our turnover rate is insane. So I have to spend time to process and think, how do I make this better for the future students? How do I grow the."
"Speaker 1","00:16:48:36","00:16:50:00","Succession planning part."
"Speaker 2","00:16:50:01","00:17:10:01","Of it? How do I grow the professional lives of the students that I have in my care? Because they're here so that they can go do on more things, and if I don't prepare them here, they won't have the opportunities that they need for whatever place God puts them in. He has given me this role to almost shepherd people, and like, that's intimidating."
"Speaker 2","00:17:10:05","00:17:18:06","But it's also so very good."
"Speaker 1","00:17:18:10","00:17:37:40","It is very powerful, extremely powerful because, in business, they use the language of religion and try to pretend that they're not. And they want to get that energy and spirit, and it's empty."
"Speaker 2","00:17:37:54","00:17:52:47","It is. And you strive and you strive and you strive and you think about King Solomon, vanity, all his vanity, all of the money in the world, all of the success, all of it is vanity, because that's the Epicurus consumption."
"Speaker 1","00:17:52:47","00:17:54:51","Conspicuous leisure. Veblen I see."
"Speaker 2","00:17:54:51","00:18:19:57","It, and I mean, it's you. It's a different view of what wealth is or what value is about people, the people that God created, the beauty that he created. And it's something that even so, my grandmother was an entrepreneur, and it kind of is a part of my family growing up. And one of the things that she used to say is, Lord, if you will bless me, let me be the keeper of your warehouse."
"Speaker 2","00:18:20:02","00:18:41:14","And that the purpose of the wealth that she had was like, yes, she was surrounded by beautiful things. And yes, she worked her butt off to get there. But yes, she was surrounded by these beautiful things and houses and clothes and networks. But but it was all for the purpose of God's plan. And whenever he said, you're given this with an open hand, and I need you to turn it out to someone else."
"Speaker 2","00:18:41:19","00:18:59:32","She was so excited. To him and to her, that's what it was. To have wealth was for the growth of things better. And I think if you if it's not that way, if you're trying to hold on to it, it's meaningless vanity. It'll never satisfy."
