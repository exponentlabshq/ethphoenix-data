"Unknown","00:00:00:00","00:00:23:21","Because I can edit if you don't ask for an answer. Over. It's all. It's all good. Okay. It's all good. All right. Good. So, my name is Mike, and it's Tyler Gentry. That's correct. That's amazing. Yeah. Tyler. Tyler will forever be associated with Fight Club to me. Oh. No kidding. I haven't watched that movie forever. You can check out."
"Unknown","00:00:23:26","00:01:00:44","Well, maybe I'm going to have to watch that. This reprised the role. So, what brings you at ease, Phoenix? Well, my buddy Shelton, he, he invited me to come down and, pitch need aid, which is, a new startup. I've been in the payment space for years, and over the last seven years, well, because of Covid and pandemic, I was at a place where, I was distributing aid on prepaid cards."
"Unknown","00:01:00:49","00:01:31:38","Yeah, the state of California tapped us to distribute about a half billion dollars in aid. And the state of New York, about 2 billion. I worked with hundreds of government agencies and non-profits over that time. And it inspired me. I mean, it made me angry because so many people have been left behind in this country. I mean, well, they've either, you know, 60, 70, 80% of Americans are not making ends meet."
"Unknown","00:01:31:40","00:01:55:51","Correct. And so, you know, they qualified for this emergency assistance. And I got a front row seat, you know like Department of Social Services, Department of Labor and all of the people that are in need of aid. That's that's why we call it needed. I am now creating a what's called a doona. It's a decentralized, unincorporated nonprofit association."
"Unknown","00:01:55:55","00:02:21:36","It's a legal framework out of, the state of Wyoming, which is where I'm originally from. Really? Yes. And I graduated from the University of Wyoming. You know, the most important state in the Western Hemisphere. Well, you know, for traditional digital assets, which is, there, you know, I think they've penned over 40, digital asset laws or related, for Wyoming to have a relationship with Arizona."
"Unknown","00:02:21:40","00:02:47:08","Yeah, that's just the best, because you got the accounting from here, and now you have TSMC and everyone else. Yes, I'm building here. So I'm interested in your payments background because I imagine they didn't just say, hey, want to distribute $1 billion of aid? You must have been doing something before I was with another. I was with a large private company in San Francisco."
"Unknown","00:02:47:13","00:03:13:20","That's been in the payments space forever. So a known entity. But at the time they did not have a public sector practice. And I just, I'd done a stint with, Governor Ducey and Sandra Watson with the, Arizona Commerce Authority. Okay. From an economic development, I was, vice president of business attraction. And so I was recruiting companies."
"Unknown","00:03:13:25","00:03:34:16","You could take a stake here and here in Arizona. You're kidding me now. And so I had this government experience, but I jumped back in that was a bit of a hiatus, but I jumped back in to the payment space and landed with this company. Covid hit. And, the demand was overwhelming. They were like, we need to get money out."
"Unknown","00:03:34:21","00:03:59:57","And cutting paper checks wasn't going to work. So they were looking for somebody to outsource payments. And there are a lot of different what I call, program managers. That provide prepaid cards and prepaid cards are an easy way to get money into somebody's hand. You know, you can be the easiest. Once it's activated, I can go into any store and use it."
"Unknown","00:03:59:59","00:04:25:46","Yeah. But I also found, tremendous amount of, fraud that actors were hacking into those. Yes. Those cards. The other thing, not all the money was being used on the prepaid cards. And so when the pandemic was finished, you know, I was inspired enough where it ignited a passion. And I said, how else can we do this?"
"Unknown","00:04:26:00","00:04:56:39","And I've been a huge fan of Bitcoin since 2014. I opened up my my, Coinbase account and started buying it. Started buying a lot of different cryptos. And of course, yes, it was for the investment. But I also thought, you know what? This is the future, digital currency, a digital dollar. And what was more exciting to me was the utility of, you know, the underlying technology of blockchain and where the consensus and the AML and the immutability, the accountable."
"Unknown","00:04:56:44","00:05:26:15","I started to see that connection of transparency and governance because I, I went to school so long ago. We were talking about double entry accounting. And what I saw with Bitcoin is an entry accounting where you can have as much metadata as you please about any debit and credit transaction. Yep. And what that does for KYC, AML, I imagine distribution of aid is has never been seen before."
"Unknown","00:05:26:17","00:05:47:50","It's you know, why didn't the payment transfer. It's a way right to build trust. You are it is. And I'll tell you like donors, there's a lot of, fatigue. Because, you know, you think about it. I give a nonprofit $10,000. I don't really know where that money went. You know, they can tell me and I can believe."
"Unknown","00:05:47:55","00:06:07:24","Look at the pie chart. But what is that? Well, it's so much of the money is going to administrative expenses, and that's fine. Like, they need to sustain their organization. But what I'm imagining is a way where we can move that donor money directly into the pockets of people that need it, and that's what we're going to do over the blockchain."
"Unknown","00:06:07:29","00:06:35:56","So we're going to we're going to issue stablecoins into digital wallets. Whoa, whoa. Yeah. People who are in need of aid. Yes. And you know what? This this is it's all about financial inclusion. So we are inviting the masses who for a long time have been excluded, you know, from traditional finance. Either they're unbanked or they're underbanked."
"Unknown","00:06:36:01","00:07:00:06","But the, the which was the motto of crypto for a long time was the right bank, the unbanked. And it was 15 years later we're like, I wonder how we're going to do it. Yes. That's what it was. So we're we're bringing that promise back. And I and I look at all of the different applications of, of the technology of cryptocurrency and now stablecoins."
"Unknown","00:07:00:11","00:07:26:14","Yeah. I have to ask. We've been talking about how might we onboard your mom? That's the joke we have. How might we onboard your mom? Because she's not good at remembering one password, and now we're giving her, like, 24 to 7000. How do you look at this process of stablecoins going into digital wallets? Which have to be kind of usable and useful ergonomically for people who may never."
"Unknown","00:07:26:21","00:07:50:41","Sure. Right. They're still unbanked today as we're having this conversation. Yeah. So to speak, in this new paradigm. Well, so when I left, prepaid prepaid cards behind. You know, I did a 360 to see, like, okay, this is the idea. But then, you know, I found organizations like Stellar Development. Foundation. Stellar assist. No. Zoom balloon."
"Unknown","00:07:50:46","00:08:20:32","Oh, right. Right. Right, right. So the cryptocurrency. Yeah. But their blockchain, you know, they're one of the originals. Layer ones. And they have a platform called the Stellar Development platform. It's mass disbursement. So they're already doing this globally. Yeah. Already doing it. Yes. They already have a tool that NGOs are using primarily. And you know and if you think about it the you you're sending payments instantly across borders."
"Unknown","00:08:20:37","00:08:45:31","No intermediaries with more visibility. You had all accountable, all visible. And so it was like what? This is already happening. It just isn't happening in the US. And that was because it was stifled by the regulations, the lack of compliance. And so people were like And so to your question about, you know, my mom how this works."
"Unknown","00:08:45:32","00:09:12:46","It's sending an email or a text. Okay. That invites them to the digital wallet to download the digital wallet which takes three minutes. And then there's a process to claim that aid. Right. And now they've just posited and begins stablecoins. And so now there's a few different options. Partnership with Moneygram to cash out like a CVS."
"Unknown","00:09:12:51","00:09:33:04","Bank transfers. You could swap it for different cryptocurrencies. You know, in a lot of these wallets. I'm working with one down in Mexico City called decaf wallet decaf. But I went out and I wanted to find like minded, partners. Yeah. So not easy now because they're not all interested in humanitarian aid. But there's a niche,"
"Unknown","00:09:33:08","00:09:39:30","There is a niche. Yes. So."
"Unknown","00:09:39:35","00:10:04:43","How do you choose your partners when there are billions of reasons to. You know what I mean? Skim off the top. Right. How do you find the people? Well, about that mission, what's going to be important for this Wyoming donor? We are actually signing an MoU next week with my alma mater, University of Wyoming. They have a center for blockchain and digital innovation."
"Unknown","00:10:04:48","00:10:30:04","You're kidding. No. And so they've invited their business school, their law school, their researchers. They are they are going to help shepherd us through, with their existing ecosystem. And we are going to we're going to launch, our proof of concept next year, probably mid next year. And it will be a closed ecosystem of 100. Wyoming 523."
"Unknown","00:10:30:10","00:10:56:00","Incredible. And then we'll also reach out to the donor community, whether that's corporations, you know, digital asset type companies that are already coming to us. They want this more than anyone. Well, they're already giving money to exactly this, you know, and the tax benefit and they're not going to stop is incredible. No. And so for for us to invite them and for them to see us like you're one of us using blockchain and stablecoin."
"Unknown","00:10:56:02","00:11:30:40","So promoting a stream of people that are have a vested interest in making sure that needed is politically, legally regulatory and compliantly. Yeah. Almost. Ahead of the game which allows which is allowed for by this University of Wyoming and then so important, you know, to have that credibility. It's everything. Yeah. I mean, it's somebody's money. But to have a proposition where we can share back with them exactly what happened, the living and how that spurs more giving."
"Unknown","00:11:30:41","00:11:58:10","So this is democratized giving in the sense that, you know, it's no longer, a government grant. It's no longer a foundation. Yes. It's like this money coming in now they decide where are the most pressing needs at any given time. And then we we fund it. So you're here today at Ethereum Phoenix. At the Bitfury event."
"Unknown","00:11:58:14","00:12:25:52","What are you telling them? How do you possibly tell them this story? Yeah. Well, I think it I think it boils down to awareness around what's happening. Correct. And what's possible as is and to be and and inviting, people to be part of it. You know, it is a community. I learned through Covid, like it takes a village."
"Unknown","00:12:25:56","00:13:00:27","There's not one single like, you know, entity that can do it, but there's power coming together. I am finding that community is the only way to have decisions made with people who are together, alone in a syndicate kind of relationship, where they all have a vested interest and maybe a portion of value chain. But if you assemble the consortium along that value chain and carry the torch like you are, yes, leave it at the time and said, congratulations."
"Unknown","00:13:00:29","00:13:25:58","Thank you. This is already happened. I'm a slow. Yeah, because the universe wants this, doesn't it? I think so spiritual. You give me, you give me goosebumps. The government, as we went along. The value chain wants this, which means that progress wants this. Whatever that is, we need it. We need to do something different. Capital. You know, it's like, millions are hurting and nobody's coming to save them."
"Unknown","00:13:26:01","00:13:55:28","Last piece. So this is the part that we may cut out. So now the, Have you heard of Molech? Moloch? No. So Molech is the, god of Mal or mis coordination from ancient religions. And so they had a name for this problem and called it Molech. And Molech is the eater of children. And it's a tragedy because we have an overabundance."
"Unknown","00:13:55:28","00:14:25:56","Yes. Yet an inability to connect. Yeah. When the distribute, even if you fight the good fight. As you fight the good fight against Molech. If there's anyone who wants to join you on this, you know, if you don't mind talking to the camera and tell them the type of spirit you're looking for when looking at new. Yeah."
"Unknown","00:14:25:59","00:15:04:01","Thunders or 501 C3, or even the University of Wyoming. Yeah. Yeah. I'm looking for people that are ready to give. I'm looking for those that, have been blessed, with abundance. And they're looking to make a real difference in where their donations go. But I like how you framed that. You know, this is, a movement of the spirit, so to speak, and, it's it's come home right here in Phoenix."
"Unknown","00:15:04:12","00:15:21:14","The law of circulation has existed before we were a species. Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you. You're doing something very important. Thank you. I'm glad we had a chance on this. Yeah. Me too. I'm going to make sure I edit all the video, make sure you have it all. That gets you card anywhere. I don't,"
