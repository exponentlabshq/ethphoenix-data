"Speaker 1","00:00:00:36","00:00:01:30","Right? Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00:00:01:35","00:00:07:03","So, how did you get into the high school?"
"Speaker 1","00:00:07:08","00:00:09:59","Jesus Christ. Yeah. High school. Jesus."
"Speaker 2","00:00:10:00","00:00:19:06","The kingdom of God be done on earth as it is in heaven. And. And phoenix. Yeah. So it seems like you caught the bug there."
"Speaker 1","00:00:19:11","00:00:40:01","I caught the bug in high school. About, just entertainment in general. I caught that bug of, like, what it is to create things and for people to enjoy things that you're doing and to get congratulations on a job well done. Or do a deejay party, and people are dancing and you're like, you hit that right beat."
"Speaker 1","00:00:40:01","00:00:46:44","And all of a sudden the whole crowd freaking moves over. It's a very exhilarating experience. Oh, okay."
"Speaker 2","00:00:46:44","00:00:47:49","And it's like the same thing."
"Speaker 1","00:00:47:49","00:00:49:48","One of our co-founders was a stand up comedian."
"Speaker 2","00:00:49:48","00:00:52:49","So you start doing crowd work with people? Yeah. This is so."
"Speaker 1","00:00:52:50","00:01:17:42","Crazy. It's crazy, but it's it's dangerous. You know? Dangerous. It's very dangerous. But yeah. So I mean, for me, I kept all that always was in the background of, like, hey, when you get a chance to do something, when you get a chance, when you figure out what it is you want to do, this is probably the best place where you're going to land."
"Speaker 1","00:01:17:47","00:01:28:37","And I figured that out with the fintech and with the tech and with the, you know, with the actual passion and just created my own story. You know, that's really what it pulled down to a."
"Speaker 2","00:01:28:42","00:01:45:14","Do you still feel it's worth maybe I'm projecting here, but do you still feel like you are walking in the path of, Whether it's Jesus or what have you?"
"Speaker 1","00:01:45:18","00:02:06:02","Oh, no. I'm, I'm, One thing I don't want to do is compare myself to Jesus or be anything I don't even want to, you know, like, I want to be the best me. And I look to prefer, which is what? Like which is what? Like he says that, he goes like, you're going to do better."
"Speaker 1","00:02:06:02","00:02:30:53","Like my brothers and sisters do greater things than I did. Like he's he's wants you to be better than him. Like, so I live in a completely different world, a different different space and a completely different experience. But I have the ability to do incredible things. And, you know, what we consider science or normal is considered was considered magic 100 years ago."
"Speaker 1","00:02:30:55","00:02:31:41","Right."
"Speaker 2","00:02:31:45","00:02:38:13","So the word technomancer come up is more magicians and spell books. Instead of prompting."
"Speaker 1","00:02:38:18","00:02:41:05","Manipulating emotions, manipulating feelings."
"Speaker 2","00:02:41:17","00:02:44:04","That are indistinguishable from magic. Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00:02:44:08","00:03:13:41","So, you know, my path is one of like which I tell everybody is like a kind of a deterministic thing. Like you write, you're you're writing your story. Like, right now, if I decide to go to the window and jump up and down and make it like I did, that was a conscious choice, right? I'm at that moment in time is going to be part of my story, and I'm the one who is the I'm the writer."
"Speaker 1","00:03:13:41","00:03:31:49","I'm the author of all of that. And if you take that approach to things, then things don't seem to, unattainable, right? Like like, oh, okay. Like I want to be in outer space. There's people that are 70 years old, they get to go to outer space. They get to experience it."
"Speaker 2","00:03:31:51","00:03:41:22","Would you say the authorship? Makes that what you experience malleable in a way?"
"Speaker 1","00:03:41:27","00:03:46:49","No, absolutely. Actually, it is malleable. Like the whole thing. The whole thing is malleable."
"Speaker 2","00:03:46:58","00:03:54:48","I don't have this conversation with a lot of people, but I can tell that through your experience, reality has become malleable."
"Speaker 1","00:03:54:53","00:04:28:57","I mean, I truly believe that we haven't people who are being their real true powers or being, suppressed, like, people do not understand their true gifts and their true abilities. And I can speak to that because until I found out that I am the author of my story, I was being, I was being, I was chaff, I was something that was getting moved left and right."
"Speaker 1","00:04:28:57","00:04:35:38","But, you know, it wasn't it wasn't me in control. The, the everything else was happening to me. And I was just reacting. Right."
"Speaker 2","00:04:35:40","00:04:36:25","The result that."
"Speaker 1","00:04:36:39","00:04:42:50","Yeah. Cause and and that sucks. It does look like you."
"Speaker 2","00:04:42:50","00:04:47:31","That's like feel weird to get pushed around the chessboard and moved off."
"Speaker 1","00:04:47:36","00:05:01:27","You're being bullied. Your life is bullying you. Correct. And you didn't realize that you didn't have to be bullied, that you you were actually the person that was bullying yourself. You were allowing yourself to be bullied so by life."
"Speaker 2","00:05:01:27","00:05:07:54","And and then what was that moment where you're with that? Because I remove that from myself for a reason."
"Speaker 1","00:05:07:59","00:05:09:27","So I mean, it's."
"Speaker 2","00:05:09:27","00:05:09:54","Like the heavens."
"Speaker 1","00:05:09:54","00:05:30:57","Opened up. Yeah. So I'm not going to go into too dark a place, but I, you know, I wasn't a happy time. It was, it was wasn't a happy time. And I was looking for answers and purpose, and I was like, I was I went on my walkabout as Aboriginals do. And really, I went on my walkabout."
"Speaker 2","00:05:31:10","00:05:31:26","Made a."
"Speaker 1","00:05:31:26","00:05:58:31","Decision. I went on my walkabout. I started walking the earth. I was literally hitchhiking everywhere, doing kind of like living life and experiencing things. And I just started, you know, being exposed to, like, the truth of that. Everything is like there are things that are always there. Things are happening underneath the surface all the time."
"Speaker 2","00:05:58:32","00:06:01:39","Many little layers of abstraction that you can lens."
"Speaker 1","00:06:01:51","00:06:24:20","That you and it's working for you if you are actively pursuing it. And if you're not actively pursuing it, it will give you clues. Life will give you clues to things, and you might be a little thing, but it's actually has big significance. And that's the thing. Like we take all of the little things that happen and we're just like, oh, coincidence, this and this and happen."
"Speaker 1","00:06:24:20","00:06:49:01","But no, if you look at it, look at it deeper, then you're like, oh, that happened at this time. You know, in this moment, specifically allowing me to open up these opportunities or this path in my life and, you know, and, and and that's the thing I'm like, and even for our platform, cinder block was what we're trying to do is we're we're trying to give people autonomy."
"Speaker 1","00:06:49:15","00:07:17:20","We're trying to give people the autonomy to create their own path. And, you know, we live in the United States of America, and it's a capitalistic society. And money moves things. Money moves things. And if you can open access to it, if you can open access to money and capital for people that have been I have been blocked from that and to allow them to fulfill their dreams."
"Speaker 2","00:07:17:25","00:07:18:30","Being blocked to that."
"Speaker 1","00:07:18:35","00:07:25:59","Well, one, let's just look at the past like they were not. You're only allowed to raise capital. You need money to make to raise capital."
"Speaker 2","00:07:26:01","00:07:29:38","I mean, you have to be an accredited investor in order to launch a future."
"Speaker 1","00:07:29:42","00:07:40:41","You you have to be you have to be a you have to have accredited investors to invest in your thing. Which how many people know a millionaire? Yeah. How many people know millionaires, especially if you're not wealthy."
"Speaker 2","00:07:40:50","00:07:43:25","To be an accredited investor to make hip hop."
"Speaker 1","00:07:43:30","00:07:47:53","Crazy. Crazy. That's why organic stuff is so called."
"Speaker 2","00:07:47:58","00:07:50:06","Jazz or any of the things that those."
"Speaker 1","00:07:50:06","00:08:12:05","Are organic things that don't require barriers like you pick up. But that's what I'm saying when it comes to Hollywood wood and music and entertainment, they're in those things. They're typically people have been locked out. You ask the average person, hey, how do I invest in a film? Will give you a zero clue. Only a very small percentage of population."
"Speaker 1","00:08:12:05","00:08:12:33","Hey, go to."
"Speaker 2","00:08:12:48","00:08:15:07","Entourage and see how do I."
"Speaker 1","00:08:15:12","00:08:35:10","Go to a film festival? And even then, there's still barriers. Like you need a network, you need somebody that's going to allow you into the game. Yeah. You need someone to give you the give you the green light. And now we're saying in general, like you don't need a green light anymore. And I think that's why a lot of Hollywood is mad at these influencers, content creators."
"Speaker 2","00:08:35:15","00:08:35:37","Because you're in."
"Speaker 1","00:08:35:37","00:08:40:04","California. Yeah. Oh, they're upset. Really. They're upset. That's when."
"Speaker 2","00:08:40:09","00:08:42:10","It's like."
"Speaker 1","00:08:42:15","00:09:00:18","Oh, dude, I've had a dude flat out get into, like, I was at the American Film Market. A dude, like just started this. Whole dudes just start trying to insult me. And I was just like, well, you know what? This is it for everybody, you know, cup of tea and signal, right? Yeah. You know, people like, they like position."
"Speaker 1","00:09:00:18","00:09:14:04","Like, if you're in a position of power, why would you want to give it up? Like, what would incentivize you unless you had some altruistic kind of thing inside of you? Why would you want to give it up like in Sinclair?"
"Speaker 2","00:09:14:18","00:09:18:40","It's hard to get a man to agree to something when his salary depends on him not agreeing on it."
"Speaker 1","00:09:18:44","00:09:19:13","So we shouldn't."
"Speaker 2","00:09:19:13","00:09:20:29","Expect them to."
"Speaker 1","00:09:20:34","00:09:40:15","You shouldn't. You shouldn't. And actually let them do their thing. Let them do their thing. How do we create our own thing? And so now if I can democratize access to capital and say, now anybody you can have a thousand people give you $100 and now you have $100,000."
"Speaker 2","00:09:40:20","00:09:41:48","And so making music."
"Speaker 1","00:09:41:50","00:09:43:15","You just have to."
"Speaker 2","00:09:43:20","00:09:44:23","Keep you out of the club."
"Speaker 1","00:09:44:28","00:10:05:31","Yeah. I mean, and now you have $100,000 to create something. And all those people either are going to get a benefit of the return of just being involved, or they're going to get the benefit of actually something financial coming back to them. But now that's these are wealth builders. And, art has always been a wealth builder for for generations."
"Speaker 2","00:10:05:42","00:10:26:26","Right. We talk about wealth building. I often tell my students that, one of the things that is out of your control as an individual is the political, legal, regulatory and compliance side. And it sounds like you have invested, what, half a decade into achieving political, legal or regulatory compliance. Can you talk about that?"
"Speaker 1","00:10:26:31","00:10:50:28","Yes. No, no, no, this is good because this is the this is the real part of it, which is that was that when I so when I was looking at this unregulated ICO crypto web3 environment, a lot of fraud, a lot of things, and there was a lot of uncertainty. And so for me, I wanted people to have certainty."
"Speaker 1","00:10:50:43","00:11:08:29","So it it kind of it's a fight against what people say is true decentralization. And nobody owns anything. Nobody is in control. But it's a spectrum being honest. It's a it's a spectrum. And there's a and there's a bridge that always needs to happen to traverse. Exactly."
"Speaker 2","00:11:08:31","00:11:17:20","Everyone. Step one Self-custody. But my mom is going to remember 25 passwords. So I give her a passkey and then slowly I will bring her into Self-custody."
"Speaker 1","00:11:17:20","00:11:17:42","Is you."
"Speaker 2","00:11:17:42","00:11:20:02","Can't remember one pass we're not going to get for 25."
"Speaker 1","00:11:20:17","00:11:34:14","That's off. That's all. Exactly. And so for for myself it was really about I first person I called was my one of my close friends. He's an entertainment, law attorney."
"Speaker 2","00:11:34:19","00:11:35:44","What was the moment."
"Speaker 1","00:11:35:49","00:11:58:04","So I so one of my professors, shout out to Orange Coast College and I was taking extension courses over there, and I was really into crypto and blockchain at the time, and I was doing their film studies program, and I was talking to him about crypto and, and he was like, well, you know, you really know a lot."
"Speaker 1","00:11:58:09","00:12:20:38","And he and I and he said, like, if you ever did something and I would invest in it, like that little belief in me for that singular moment championed my whole, my whole cause it was like, okay, now I'm going to figure something out."
"Speaker 2","00:12:20:42","00:12:25:41","So last question then, if you could talk to him today and look into the camera, what would you say to him?"
"Speaker 1","00:12:25:46","00:12:38:49","Thank you. I talked to him already. He's an investor, so I talk to him. All right. Yeah I yeah I thank him I'm like thank you for that. And I just talk I hang out like you know you got to embrace the people that helped you get to where you are."
"Speaker 2","00:12:38:49","00:12:42:43","So yes, to you,"
"Speaker 1","00:12:42:48","00:13:18:03","I think again, like if you see a spark in somebody and you have an, an altruistic, a good, feeling about helping or pushing that forward, you should say something like, you, the time is now. And he should saw something in me. And he gave me that little push to get me thinking in the direction of, like, I'm about to build something and I'm going to go through heaven, hell and earth just to get there, and I'm going to drag everybody with me."
"Speaker 1","00:13:18:08","00:13:26:08","That's really kind of where cinderblock was born. And, and I thank my co-founders for coming in involved and getting me, getting me going."
"Speaker 2","00:13:26:08","00:13:28:16","So grants an honor."
"Speaker 1","00:13:28:21","00:13:30:00","Likewise. Likewise, man."
"Speaker 2","00:13:30:14","00:13:30:49","Belief is the."
"Speaker 1","00:13:30:49","00:13:35:49","Cause. Hey, man, the time is now. That's what I always tell people. The time is always right now."
"Speaker 2","00:13:36:00","00:13:36:25","It is."
