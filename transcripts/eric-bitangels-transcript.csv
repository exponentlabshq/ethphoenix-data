"Speaker 1","00:00:00:30","00:00:04:01","Early and didn't hold you back that much."
"Speaker 2","00:00:04:06","00:00:06:02","Guys, you guys have, like."
"Speaker 1","00:00:06:06","00:00:12:52","Five minutes. Five minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Man two for two for. Yes. And so just if you guys can,"
"Speaker 3","00:00:12:57","00:00:14:18","Just takes pictures."
"Speaker 1","00:00:14:23","00:00:15:17","Just like."
"Speaker 3","00:00:15:22","00:00:15:38","You said."
"Speaker 1","00:00:15:38","00:01:00:43","And I know for recording and your, like, somewhere, you know. Now, also true of the mic. Is it somewhere over there is. It's out. Okay. Sorry. There you go. Amazing. We're almost done. So, hello. My name is Michael Jagger, and I'm a headhunter launching startups with the syndicate. Today we find ourselves in beautiful downtown Phoenix, Arizona, and we are joined by Eric from Bit Angels, who has amassed some of the most powerful startups in the digital currency and digital asset ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere."
"Speaker 1","00:01:00:47","00:01:27:59","I myself went to Bitcoin Vegas and nobody was talking about US GAAP. The focus on the political, legal, regulatory compliance fulcrum is a testament to your vision. So congratulations. Thank you. Feels like you've won because there's 55,000 other people in this network in Arizona. Yeah. That are looking for people that can identify the true problems worth solving. I think you do that today."
"Speaker 1","00:01:28:06","00:01:28:51","Congratulations."
"Speaker 3","00:01:28:53","00:01:51:24","Well thank you. It was a great opportunity to kind of pull a community together. We've been looking at these problems for quite a while, and there's problem and solutions. Then there's breakthroughs. And I think we're at that catalyst where things are going to pop and things are going to be a little bit different. You know, it's really exciting to be creating a future instead of trying to solve just problems."
"Speaker 3","00:01:51:24","00:02:12:07","But really, we've had a group of talented developers, financiers and Ben Angels tries to connect companies founders with capital, and we want to build that ecosystem so that it can thrive. And I think we've done a good job at least launching that here in Arizona."
"Speaker 1","00:02:12:07","00:02:25:02","Now you have. I just had an opportunity to interview Asa's. Yeah. The winner, the collateralized debt positions that can help municipalities keep the lights on. Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00:02:25:02","00:02:26:16","Isn't that awesome? I mean."
"Speaker 1","00:02:26:25","00:02:29:40","You see the same thing I saw when I. What did you see in them?"
"Speaker 3","00:02:29:44","00:02:53:45","Well, I just see amazing talent and not only amazing talent, but a future worth living inside of. These people are creating the future. And it's just such a relief to witness that kind of commitment, that kind of, talent, that kind of drive. Because the world, you know, it's a people are wondering what's going to go on. We're in good hands."
"Speaker 3","00:02:53:51","00:02:55:18","People like this."
"Speaker 1","00:02:55:22","00:03:08:13","I believe so, yeah. Any final words for the people that are looking to attract capital in this space? Can you let them know what kind of competition they're facing? Because this room had some of the stiffest competition I've seen."
"Speaker 3","00:03:08:18","00:03:24:51","Yeah, well, competition is really a good thing. It is because this is a collaborative effort. And rather than compete, we collaborate. And to do that, we create a whole ecosystem that builds things that work in a better life for everybody."
"Speaker 1","00:03:24:56","00:03:29:02","I can't imagine was easy, but I imagine it is worth it. Congratulations."
"Speaker 3","00:03:29:02","00:03:30:28","Thank you."
"Speaker 1","00:03:30:32","00:03:32:03","Thanks. We did it."
"Speaker 3","00:03:32:08","00:03:32:42","All right, we got one."
"Speaker 1","00:03:32:42","00:03:36:04","More gut chow."
"Speaker 3","00:03:36:09","00:03:40:57","Richard, now! So what are you going to do after this?"
"Speaker 1","00:03:41:02","00:03:41:41","Not sure."
"Speaker 3","00:03:41:43","00:03:47:09","This is it. That's good. Right? We're supposed to be out of here. So we're going to. This is like two minutes."
"Speaker 1","00:03:47:23","00:03:55:00","I'm going to find out. Richard. Welcome. Did he. Richard's microphone or did he. Thanks for sharing it. He said it."
