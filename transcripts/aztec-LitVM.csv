"Speaker 1","00:00:00:00","00:00:02:44","Okay. Can you testers still good?"
"Speaker 2","00:00:02:45","00:00:06:03","Still good. Testing. Testing. Okay, cool."
"Speaker 1","00:00:06:08","00:00:24:40","I'm saying about Bitfury for a while. Beautiful. So we will do the. Because I'm editing. Don't worry. This is going to be completely relaxed. I'm just tidying up the cameras."
"Speaker 1","00:00:24:45","00:00:55:33","Hello. My name is Michael Jagger, and I'm a headhunter launching startups with the syndicate. I am in gorgeous downtown Phoenix, Arizona. And if you haven't been here, you need to get here. Because I believe after the people I met here today, including Aztec, that Phoenix, you know, they call themselves Phoenicians. This might be the new Phoenicia. You know what I'm saying?"
"Speaker 1","00:00:55:38","00:01:10:34","The new Phoenician. Because you have everything from the Five Seas to Nvidia and TSMC. Seriously, looking at Arizona has to create maybe the most powerful state in the Western Hemisphere."
"Speaker 2","00:01:10:39","00:01:11:17","Let's do it."
"Speaker 1","00:01:11:30","00:01:14:03","That's what I said. What do you say?"
"Speaker 2","00:01:14:08","00:01:43:29","Well, there is a lot of money moving into Arizona. You have the chips coming in. We have some really great regulators. So policy is opening up and there's a lot more of us. Blockchain cypherpunks misfits. As someone said at this, a bit angels today in Arizona. So I think it's time to rally everyone up and create the The Avengers super team."
"Speaker 1","00:01:43:34","00:01:50:50","So you saying the do you see the misfits coming to, Phoenix and Arizona broadly?"
"Speaker 2","00:01:50:55","00:02:06:20","I could see more us attracting people, creating, sandboxes and things so that they want to build here. But I think we have a lot of misfits already."
"Speaker 1","00:02:06:25","00:02:10:07","What brought you to this event?"
"Speaker 2","00:02:10:12","00:02:38:40","So, Eric, he is a city leader at BitAngels, and I'm supporting him. And Richard at BitAngels. Michael Terpin, our, full stack blockchain venture studio, which is Lunar Digital Assets, is involved with the global, development of BitAngels, and I kind of got thrown into it. They said, hey, you have a lot of experience."
"Speaker 2","00:02:38:40","00:03:10:35","You know, I was instrumental in, launching and incubating projects like polygon and Quick Swap and, now I'm a founder of a project called lit VMware, the first Litecoin layer two, fully endorsed by. Yeah. Litecoin Foundation and Charlie Lee. So they said, hey, you got some experience and you've done a lot of things. And so here I am, I'm here to support."
"Speaker 1","00:03:10:40","00:03:33:29","So when I think about layer twos, I think about the trade offs that layer ones make on the trilemma, the cap theorem, the, you know, the dex triangle. How do how does your layer two, shore up that solution trade off being made at the Litecoin layer one?"
"Speaker 2","00:03:33:34","00:04:02:57","Well, it's a bit of a hybrid model. So it's really, a great tech play because we're bringing in the, pioneers on the Bitcoin side of things, which is a team called Bitcoin OS. And we're working with, some core teams on the Ethereum side of things, the Zcash side, bringing them together. And it'll essentially roll up to Ethereum and like coin both."
"Speaker 1","00:04:03:52","00:04:06:26","Really how does that work?"
"Speaker 2","00:04:06:31","00:04:10:00","Basically by way of, ZK proofs."
"Speaker 1","00:04:10:05","00:04:11:10","Okay."
"Speaker 2","00:04:11:15","00:04:43:06","And, I'm not on the technical side, so I can't really dive into all of everything, but, essentially we're, going to bring light coin trustless into Web3. Currently, there isn't, any, fully trustless decentralized options. There's centralized or trust minimized options for, like, coin, and there's a lot of institutions and digital asset treasuries and funds that want to build strategies."
"Speaker 2","00:04:43:09","00:04:51:37","So we're essentially going to and we're actually already talking to these individuals to build this stuff out for them."
"Speaker 1","00:04:51:41","00:05:12:14","When I think about the advent of layer two is what I see is the emergence of finance 3.0, where we move from having these, silos of Maxis to finally, true interoperability is that what you see?"
"Speaker 2","00:05:12:19","00:05:47:30","That's definitely where I think everything's going. You see all these different camps and everyone's kind of building in their camp. There's mindshare in each specific camp, but interoperability by way of ZK technology, because that technology has matured, greatly over the last couple of years, is really going to, in my opinion, bring everyone together. So you're going to see the sound money, hard money guys starting to collaborate more with the Ethereum bros and all the UT bro's are going to be able to do things that they haven't been able to do in the past."
"Speaker 2","00:05:47:34","00:06:00:00","AI is going to help with user experience and you know all the other categories are basically going to kind of intersect over time."
"Speaker 1","00:06:00:04","00:06:31:03","And that's me. Wind down. Here, right now it seems like we are surrounded by the trial fortuna of design development and distribution. But this is just my third day in Arizona. What do you see with this combination of designers, developers, and then the marketers or distributors kind of all coming together at the same time?"
"Speaker 2","00:06:31:08","00:06:36:03","Well, basically, are you asking mainly like in Arizona or more broadly."
"Speaker 1","00:06:36:03","00:06:59:18","Just your experience with the people that you've met here? Because I've found them to be very mature thinkers in terms of how interoperability will work, because design and development without the political, legal and regulatory compliance side is almost dead. But you guys have that here. So the amount of coordination that you have compared to other ecosystems is very mature."
"Speaker 1","00:06:59:22","00:07:01:27","Is that what keeps you here?"
"Speaker 2","00:07:01:32","00:07:28:22","Definitely. Also, I think we're still very early. A lot of people at this event were talking about how we have a lot to do in Arizona. The good thing, though, is that we're seeing that there is a lot of appetite and hunger to build freedom technologies and work together. So what I think will happen is that essentially everyone through events just like this are going to start working together."
"Speaker 2","00:07:28:22","00:08:00:43","And as technology gets better and better with like, I will be able to do a lot more with smaller teams. And, I spoke to many really talented individuals like you're saying that, want to put all of our heads together in on distribution marketing, but also, you know, infrastructure sandboxes, regulatory type, endeavors, etc., etc. and I think this is really actually the starting point for something really great for Arizona."
"Speaker 1","00:08:00:48","00:08:33:22","Now, the last thing I'll say as we wind down here is you said a phrase there, freedom technologies. As someone who, had their parents leave Guyana and come to Canada because of a loss of freedom that happened in the 70s, right? If America has done anything well, it is adopting freedom. And at a time where technology almost allows us to break that freedom and, like, just delete it from history."
"Speaker 1","00:08:33:27","00:08:45:40","I believe that, Arizona and North America at large, if we have a competitive advantage, it's to almost re-embrace freedom. What do you think?"
"Speaker 2","00:08:45:44","00:08:52:24","Definitely. And I'm excited to see that. You know, there's really brilliant minds coming out of ASU right now and in,"
"Speaker 1","00:08:52:29","00:08:56:07","In JCU, Grand Canyon. Oh my God."
"Speaker 2","00:08:56:12","00:09:22:55","And what's exciting is that a lot of these individuals that I'm speaking to, you care about freedom. Yes, they care about decentralization. And this is so important because in a world, there's kind of two paths where one side, you know, the technocrats or, you know, these really big tech companies essentially could come in and turn us all into, you know, just consume or bass drum."
"Speaker 1","00:09:22:55","00:09:25:30","And lemmings with an alphabet. You know what I mean? Here."
"Speaker 2","00:09:25:43","00:09:49:15","And or we can come in with, with all these brilliant minds come together, build decentralized communities. And the future could be, more. We could protect our privacy, our fundamental rights. We can build freedom. Technologies. And the future could look a lot better. So hopefully that's. You know what we all fight for here."
"Speaker 1","00:09:49:20","00:10:08:31","And finally, for the light coin enthusiasts that have been waiting for an or two, we have stacks for Bitcoin and there's lights for everyone else. Now that we have an to for Litecoin, for all the light coin developers and enthusiasts, can you tell them how to get involved?"
"Speaker 2","00:10:08:36","00:10:35:30","Sure. So I would say start off with our 18 page research paper. You can get it for free. You don't have to download it. You just go to our website. It's lit tvm.com. And you look at the top right hand corner of the, page. Learn more. You see the silver standard? We go really deep into why light coin and the opportunity that's there."
"Speaker 1","00:10:35:44","00:10:38:59","That's a silver standard. Yeah. That's the way you look at Litecoin."
"Speaker 2","00:10:39:04","00:10:41:31","I do. There's a gold and silver standard."
"Speaker 1","00:10:41:31","00:11:08:56","Shall we need to spend a lot more time together. That silver gold relationship is very powerful. I don't think Litecoin is going away anytime soon. It's if that's true, that silver analogy might be very powerful. If you look at what happened with the appreciation of assets, both the guy debating Peter Schiff and Peter Schiff were both right because gold and Bitcoin were at all time highs together."
"Speaker 1","00:11:09:01","00:11:17:59","So it turns out that the debaters were both right. And that goes to show that multiple people can be correct at the same time."
"Speaker 2","00:11:18:13","00:11:19:31","That's why."
"Speaker 1","00:11:19:36","00:11:26:44","And that is a great news for every maxi for a minute or anyone in between. Aztek, thank you so much."
"Speaker 2","00:11:26:46","00:11:27:36","Pleasure. Thank you."
"Speaker 1","00:11:27:36","00:11:32:41","Honor. Bang! Let's do it. That was great."
"Speaker 2","00:11:32:45","00:11:34:20","Yeah, the tech side of it."
"Speaker 1","00:11:34:24","00:11:35:02","It's all good."
