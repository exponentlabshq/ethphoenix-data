"Unknown","00:21:54:28","00:22:21:23","Jonathan Chambless. Jonathan Chambless, I connected with you on LinkedIn. So we're really friends now? Yes, Jonathan. You know, like meeting face to face is one thing, but LinkedIn. That's like married. Absolutely. In corporate. Right. With all 8000 other people I'm married with. It's like the largest polygamous relationship ever. Let's talk about a sin again, Sin? Yeah."
"Unknown","00:22:21:24","00:22:56:09","I'm not. I'm not signing up for that. No. So, I, I'm sure you associate with many, different organizations at this event at Phoenix with BitAngels. What capacity, I guess. Would you say you're huge angel? Yeah. So Sandi was kind enough to let me crash her event. Sandi? Women of Web3. I've. I've had a, relationship with Shelton and stand with crypto ever since my time with, blockchain at ASU and doubles down."
"Unknown","00:22:56:11","00:23:26:00","Gotcha. I have been. I was given the opportunity to work with, Georgia StandWithCrypto chapter president because of Shelton. And so I presented or was getting an opportunity for that, Atlanta tech week, earlier this year. I'm really excited to be working with Sandy, specifically because I was able to introduce her with Blake Spurgeon."
"Unknown","00:23:26:03","00:24:00:29","Startup fund and startup Central. They are, new startup incubation platform based off, advanced manufacturing and incubation. They have a Solana based token. And, when I first met Sandy, I asked her to understand the relationship that myself. Herself and Blake could have if I could convince her to drive up from where she lives in Sandton, all the way up to Tempe."
"Unknown","00:24:01:02","00:24:30:03","And she did. God bless. She made the trip, and, she recognized why I could help both of their brands with, compliance understanding. Being a a, circle developer. Circle financial services developer. I can speak. You are? Yes, sir. Wow. I represented, Circle dev for ETH global last year and Singapore marketing. Yeah."
"Unknown","00:24:30:06","00:25:09:20","So you're actually standing with crypto. You're not just sitting with crypto here. Let me answer that question, because most CTOs and CFOs don't give a crap about crypto. Okay. Broadly, what they do care about is what they pay for payroll and what they pay to process transactions. The ADP side of their relationship. If you aren't incurring a additional risk by introducing crypto with yes volatility and you focus on a stable approach, all of a sudden now local CTOs and CFOs who are wanting to reap in the cost of processing benefits, especially in a cross compliance, cross jurisdictional capacity."
"Unknown","00:25:09:22","00:25:40:07","Now we're talking about something that can add value to an existing organization, whether they understand blockchain or not. And God bless. That took me four years to get through. So what you're saying is that if you're a multinational corporation, yes, sir. And you're responsible for the salaries and Friday paydays, across time zones or a Friday, one day, a Saturday, another needing to fulfill data retention requirements in every jurisdiction, including GDPR, mica."
"Unknown","00:25:40:08","00:26:29:22","Yes, GDPR, mica in Europe. Yeah. Correct. Or whatever the monetary authority of Singapore is. Sure. Sure. So what you're saying is that where a lot of these the column, the fortune 2000 may not be all that interested in cryptocurrency. However, if they can add if they can reduce their foreign exchange risk across the world through staple products in a way that achieves political, legal, regulatory and compliance as a stack, as a stack, because the political, legal, regulatory and compliance is the fulcrum upon which companies live and die."
"Unknown","00:26:29:25","00:27:03:07","If you want their trust. Yes. Correct. And so you built this, I am also a governor of the Accumulate Foundation. Wow. And the accumulate foundation is the historical compliance L1 for some of the most sophisticated tokenized securities in the market today globally. So you're saying compliance L1. Yes. I don't think I've come across it. Can you say more words accumulate foundation."
"Unknown","00:27:03:10","00:27:29:18","Accumulate network previously known as factum. I remember factum okay. Keep going. So Jay Smith and Paul Snow, the founders. Yes. Accumulate. Paul Snow is an original Ethereum fellow and was responsible for the young with the Ernst and Young. No, that's Paul Brody. So I can tell Brody I do have a relationship with Paul Brody. I like Paul."
"Unknown","00:27:29:18","00:27:51:21","He invited me to speak on industrial payroll. Okay, because NY was pushing their own, not pushing, but they had their own ideas for iprs that would help my solution work. I met him at centrifuge, New York City. How long ago was this? Two years ago. Okay, because I've only been following what Paul's been doing online, and he's been really pushing."
"Unknown","00:27:51:24","00:28:26:24","Ernst and Young, he he is aligned with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, of whom asked me to speak on global payroll compliance and industrial manufacture sharing. Would you say that the, multinational payroll with political, legal, regulatory compliance and, forex benefits, let's say. Is that your main focus for here today? I would umbrella all of those under a corporate digital asset, treasury debt, corporate digital."
"Unknown","00:28:26:24","00:28:42:27","If you want to have a corporate debt in compliance you should check out micro pay technologies. So in a nutshell, you're here today to introduce."
"Unknown","00:28:43:00","00:29:10:28","Corporate digital asset treasury of which one use case is reducing foreign exchange risk for salaries. Just one. That's just one because the political, legal, regulatory and compliance environment is the fulcrum upon which companies live and die. If they want to continue working, it's got to be stable enough for people to be able to work with it. And we finally have that."
"Unknown","00:29:11:00","00:29:38:00","Now, given your background, have you been looking at all this 402 agent agents? Yeah. So I, I worked, directly with the circle and Amazon team on the new Arc protocol arc. Can you spell arc for me? Because I know if you arc ask arc, it's their mSRP product. Are you talking about the regressed? No."
"Unknown","00:29:38:03","00:30:02:16","I think that. Okay, because I know arg1. No, no. So centrifuge just within a couple of days, have launched their own L1 not interface can be circle. Circle has circle their own L1 and the gas fees are Usdc. And it uses an MCP format that I help work with. I need to talk to you more. And, that's what I'm here to do."
"Unknown","00:30:02:17","00:30:31:16","Well, it's because Rocky went to Aptos. Okay. I'll say. All right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So hyperscalers. Right. The the, AI enabled L ones are the ones who are most going to benefit from account abstraction and cross-chain interactions. So having worked in securities compliance for the last four years, I can speak to both the Web2 and the Web3 space very, very clearly and effectively."
"Unknown","00:30:31:19","00:30:55:14","So last question then, because I could talk to you all day on this, and I think obviously at the pitch you have to pitch for 230. So, total addressable market of $4 trillion in at least I have to offer some semblance without getting over my skis. I understand, but, I mean, we're in the business of getting in over our skis, right?"
"Unknown","00:30:55:17","00:31:25:06","You may be in the business of getting it. That's why you. When I take a compliance first approach, I have to play ball in the, corporate digital asset treasury organization. Is that, a direct response to, the federal government's adoption or. Yep. Clarity genius. The new genius and clarity. In addition to new GAAP accounting principles."
"Unknown","00:31:25:08","00:32:03:23","So the GAAP accounting principles have been here a little longer, but the new regulatory authority, right. Christen. They christen the GAAP because what you're saying is that stable, the stable and genius legislations become reportable, become implemented through the generally accepted accounting accounting procedures. That's my first year I get it. So we've really come full circle because for crypto or for this new world to be, crystallized in GAAP."
"Unknown","00:32:03:25","00:32:27:12","Yeah, that is the watershed moment within cross jurisdictional retention requirements. But wouldn't you say that once the genius and stable act coming out and then they get translate into GAAP, then places like the Monetary Authority of Singapore and everywhere else kind of will follow that. I would argue circle has been driving for that outcome for a long time."
"Unknown","00:32:27:12","00:32:55:17","For a long time. It's an honor. I did not expect this. Thank you. I'm glad I I'm glad I, had a chance to start today with this because I think this puts it in the appropriate light. There's a saying in Colombia you cannot block the sun with your finger. And so good luck. Now that crypto is entering into us generally accepted accounting principles."
"Unknown","00:32:55:19","00:33:15:28","Maybe not fun for a lot of people, but it's dull. It's boring and it's not sexy and it's critical. But if you want to talk to CTOs and CFOs of the language corporation, then you have to language in a compliance way. And if it is not stipulated by US GAAP, it's actually they can't even hear what you're saying."
"Unknown","00:33:15:28","00:33:33:02","It's additional risk of which they're paid to prevent for their corporation. We are loathe to add risk to our portfolio, especially if and when it's not our money. Absolutely. Congratulations. Thank you Jim. It's an honor. Great job."
